    "title": "Beware of SIM Swap Frauds That Can Steal Your Money This Pune CA Lost Rs 2 2 Lakh",
    "body": "2020/09/14 - In a new case of SIM card swapping fraud, scammers reportedly duped a Pune-based chartered accountant of Rs 2. 2 lakh from her bank account. The phishing fraud is said to have happened on May 28, when the victim, whose name was not revealed in the report, received a call from scammers that pretended to be engaged with her telecom operator. During the conversation, they seemingly convinced her that she was still using a 3G SIM card, which required urgent upgrade to 4G or risked being blocked immediately. A report by ET Telecom states that after receiving the call, the 39-year-old was duped into believing that the callers were legitimate. The scammers made the victim reveal certain key details about her phone number, following which they reportedly sent a 20-digit code to her phone number and asked her to click on it. Soon after this, the victim’s original SIM card was automatically deactivated, and the scammers took control of her number on a cloned SIM card that they now possessed, with her number registered on it. They then used it to siphon off funds worth Rs 2. 2 lakh from her account. The report reveals that the victim then received alerts of transactions being made from her bank account, following which she alerted her bank and blocked access to her account – but not before facing a significant loss already. An FIR on the matter was then lodged with the police department at Pune’s Alankar Police Station. According to the report, the police are still investigating the case of fraud, and the clear suspicion behind this scam is one of SIM card swapping fraud. SIM swapping frauds are among the most common form of phishing frauds that occur on a regular basis. To stay safe from such incidents, users are requested to not share any sensitive details over phone, unless they specifically opt for phone banking services via authorised contact hotlines of banks. It is always advised that users remain constantly vigilant about sharing any form of technical details about their particulars, and any SIM upgrade activities should only be performed by a user in person by visiting the stores of their telecom operators.

    "title": "Apple iPhone Makers May Be Gainers In 6 6 Billion India Plan Report",
    "body": "2020/09/14 - India is betting that many global brands will be keen to reduce their dependence on China. Apple Inc. ’s major iPhone assemblers are among the companies expected to win approval to participate in a $6. 6 billion stimulus program to bring manufacturing to India, according to people familiar with the matter, a potentially seismic shift as the world’s most valuable company diversifies beyond China. At a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, the government is expected to approve a plan aimed at bringing $150 billion in mobile-phone production over the next five years, said people, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Among the dozen phone makers already cleared by a high-powered government committee are Apple’s primary supplier Foxconn Technology Group, which had submitted two applications, and peers Wistron Corporation and Pegatron Corporation, the people said. The three companies make virtually every iPhone sold globally in sprawling factories currently located mainly in China. Under the Production Linked Incentive program, or PLI as it’s called, manufacturing incentives will rise each year in an ongoing effort to entice the world’s biggest smartphone brands to make their products in India and export to the world. Besides the Apple contractors, Samsung Electronics is the only other applicant for the five slots allotted to foreign companies. China’s largest phone makers Huawei Technologies and BBK Group, which manufactures brands such as Oppo and Vivo, are conspicuous by their absence. Amid rising trade and political tensions between the U. S. and China, India is betting that many global brands will be keen to reduce their dependence on China. If successful, the program could set in motion a shift in electronics manufacturing in the next five years. “It’s a thoughtful move by the government aimed at wooing Apple to bring significant iPhone manufacturing to India because, when the iPhone maker shifts, an entire ecosystem follows,” said Hari Om Rai, chairman and founder of Lava International Ltd. , India’s largest homegrown phone maker. “The next five years will be dramatic, and India could become the new China in phone manufacturing. ” Lava, based in the New Delhi suburbs, is among the Indian phone makers applying for manufacturing incentives, along with Karbonn Mobiles and Dixon Technologies India Ltd. To receive the incentives, foreign manufacturers including Foxconn, Wistron and Samsung must commit to specific investment and production targets of devices that sell for at least Rs 15,000 ($200); Indian phone makers will have no such restrictions. Last month, Ravi Shankar Prasad, minister for electronics and information technology, told reporters that Apple accounts for 37 per cent and Samsung 22 per cent of global sales revenue share from mobile phones. The incentive scheme would “increase their manufacturing base manifold in the country,” the ministry said in a statement. Apple did not respond to requests for comment. Pegatron, the second-largest iPhone assembler after Foxconn with a number of factories in China, said in July that it would set up a plant in India. Apple accounts for more than half of Pegatron’s business. If approved, Pegatron’s first India factory would be eligible for PLI, the people said. In the next five years, India could attract an additional 10 per cent of global handset production, Credit Suisse said in a recent note. And though the country is the world’s second-largest handset market with plenty of room for domestic sales growth, the government’s clear aim is to eventually become a global manufacturing colossus to rival China. Almost two-thirds of the stimulus program is targeted at the export market, the people said. Pankaj Mohindroo, chairman of India Cellular and Electronics Association, a trade group that represents leading phone makers including Apple, Oppo and Xiaomi, said incoming handset makers will be accompanied by a host of smaller sub-assemblers and component makers, expanding the sector to seven times its current size in the next five or so years. “India’s incentive scheme will be a game-changer that will make the country No. 1 mobile in mobile manufacturing, or at least a close No. 2 by 2025,” Mr Mohindroo said.

    "title": "Microsoft Says Its Buyout Offer for TikTok Rejected as Deadline Looms for Chinese owned App",
    "body": "2020/09/14 - US tech giant Microsoft has said its offer to buy TikTok was rejected, as a deadline looms for the Chinese-owned video app to sell or shut down its US operations. TikTok has been at the center of a diplomatic storm between Washington and Beijing, and President Donald Trump gave Americans a deadline to stop doing business with TikTok’s Chinese parent company ByteDance – effectively compelling a sale of the app to a US company. Trump claims that TikTok could be used by China to track the locations of federal employees, build dossiers on people for blackmail and conduct corporate espionage. “ByteDance let us know today they would not be selling TikTok’s US operations to Microsoft,” the US tech giant said in a statement referring to TikTok’s owner. “We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok’s users, while protecting national security interests,” the statement added. Following Trump’s executive order, Microsoft and Oracle were possible suitors to take over TikTok operations. Microsoft said that it would have “made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combatting disinformation. ” The Wall Street Journal and New York Times reported that Oracle had won the bidding war, citing people familiar with the deal, although the company did not immediately confirm the matter to AFP. The Oracle bid would next need approval from the White House and Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a source told the Journal, with both parties under the belief it would meet US data security concerns. TikTok has filed a lawsuit challenging the crackdown by the US government, contending that Trump’s order was a misuse of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act because the platform is not “an unusual and extraordinary threat. ” Downloaded 175 million times in the US, TikTok is used by as many as a billion people worldwide to make quirky, short-form videos on their cellphones. It has repeatedly denied sharing data with Beijing. "

    "title": "Hospitals turn to robots to clear backlog of elective surgeries amid covid 19",
    "body": "2020/09/14 - Leading hospitals in India including Tata Memorial, Apollo Hospitals, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Manipal Hospitals are turning to robots to clear the backlog of elective surgeries that had to be put on hold after the covid-19 outbreak to reduce the risk of exposure to patients and doctors. Though RAS (robotic assisted surgeries) has been around for many years, the usage has been sporadic. Post covid-19, the fear of crowded spaces and higher risk of infection due to prolonged stays in hospitals is making patients seek out robotic surgeries as an alternative to traditional open surgeries. “After the pandemic, we have been seeing an increase in demand for robotic surgery as the procedure allows for social distancing with lesser people around the patient and robot. The infection rates are lower as compared to laparoscopy and open surgeries,” said Amol Kumar Patil, consultant, Robotic Surgery &amp; Urology, Apollo Hospitals, Navi Mumbai. In March, the ministry of health and family welfare issued an advisory, urging hospitals across the country to put all non-essential elective surgeries on hold. This led to a backlog of surgeries. CovidSurg Collaborative, an international research consortium, has estimated that 5,05,800 elective surgeries including 51,100 cancer surgeries and 27,700 obstetric surgeries were delayed or cancelled in India due to the imposition of lockdown and fear of infection. “There is a sense of fear among patients to get treatment at hospitals. They are resisting treatment that involves any physical contact with surgeons and that requires longer hospital stays after surgery,” said Avanish Saklani, professor robotic/colorectal MS, FRCS, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai. Traditional surgeries involve a large team of doctors that have to operate for long hours and use hundreds instruments for the completion of one surgery. “Due to the invasive cutting of the wound and excessive bleeding, the patient might develop post-surgery infections leading to higher risk of contracting the virus,” said Somashekhar S P, chairman &amp; HOD Surgical Oncology, MHEPL. Somashekhar explains, to avoid further backlog of surgeries, SAGE and Associations of Robotic consortium discussed new methods of conducting surgeries in the new covid-19 era. They compared traditional methods of surgery to robotic-assisted surgery and found that robotics had several benefits that were proving to be beneficial during covid-19. For instance, RAS involves just 4 instruments and a very small team of medical professionals in the operating room. The procedure is also less painful and causes less blood loss as the wound is just few millimetres in the subcuticular. Patients recover faster from the surgery, leading to early discharge. Somasekar points out, robotic surgeries are also more convenient for doctors and allows them to perform many surgeries in a single day without feeling fatigued. The surgeries are performed by robotic arms are controlled by a doctor sitting at a remote console with access to 12 times magnified 3D view of the surgery. “During the initial days of the lockdown, people were avoiding surgeries, but now it is picking pace. As of now, 60% of the surgeries we are doing is through robotics,” said Sudhir Kumar Rawal, director – Surgical Oncology, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute.

    "body": "2020/09/14 - Charlie Russell, 27, is one of an estimated 600,000 people with post-Covid illness, a condition that may give an insight into ME It’s day 182 after being infected by Covid-19, and Charlie Russell is not doing the things that other 27-year-olds are doing. He’s not running 5km three times a week like he used to. He’s not going to the pub. He’s not working. And he’s not getting better. “If I had known that I’d be this ill, I would have taken everything a lot more seriously back in March,” Russell said. “But all that we heard back then was that if you were infected and you were a young person, you’d most likely not have any symptoms at all. Or you’d be ill for a couple of weeks and that would be it. ” Instead, Russell has suffered from chest pains, excruciating migraines, severe breathlessness, dizziness and exhaustion, one of the legions of “long Covid” sufferers who have experienced long-term symptoms from the coronavirus. Record numbers of people in their 20s are testing positive for covid-19, according to the latest figures from Public Health England, which showed 3,366 had the virus in the first week of September. That is higher than the 3,325 cases at the end of April, although those tests were mostly conducted on people in hospitals. Although people under 40 face a much lower risk of dying from the illness, 20-somethings like Russell are catching covid-19 in far higher numbers than other age groups: 20- to 29-year-olds make up nearly 28% of all new infections. Few will need hospital treatment, but long-Covid support groups and medical experts fear that a significant minority will end up with a severely debilitating condition that scientists do not yet understand. “We’ve got this terrific emphasis at the moment on the idea that younger people will be OK and the main reason they shouldn’t go out is because they might infect their grannies,” said Charles Shepherd, medical adviser to the ME Association which supports people with myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome. The association has seen substantial numbers of long-Covid patients turning to it for support. “There is a risk that if younger people catch the disease, they may not end up in hospital but they could have an illness that leaves them exhausted with post-Covid syndrome. It’s not going to happen to the majority, but there is a real risk for a significant minority,” Shepherd said. About 600,000 people have some sort of post-Covid illness, according to Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London, who says that around 12% of sufferers report symptoms to the Covid Tracker app for longer than 30 days. One in 200 says the effects last for more than 90 days. Russell, who is a photographer specialising in theatre, has not worked since he fell ill. He is precise about the date: 14 March. “I’ve had plenty of time to look back and think, what was I doing then? And how I wished I hadn’t been doing that. ” His illness lasted two weeks and he felt better not long afterwards, then experienced terrifying chest pains “like someone was sitting on me”. But hospital doctors and his GP said tests showed there were no problems – a common experience of long-Covid patients, according to Frances Simpson, a founder of the support group Long Covid SOS, who says many struggle to have their symptoms taken seriously by the medical profession. Russell was luckier than most – he changed GP, and the new doctor ordered an antibody test which confirmed he had had the virus. He is now one of 500 patients taking part in the Coverscan clinical trial into the impact of Covid-19. “When people refuse to wear masks or to even obey the most basic of social distance rules, it’s very, very frustrating,” Russell said. “I just want to shake them and say ‘I’ve been living with this for six months’. “I think a lot of young people – and it’s human nature – think that if something doesn’t affect you directly, it almost doesn’t exist. Friends of mine who are still going out to the pubs, still going out to dinners and not really taking it that seriously. I do worry for them. ” Russell was in good condition before the virus hit, with his regular 5km runs timed at about 23 minutes. Now he struggles to climb stairs. Long Covid SOS and other groups say that their members receive little help and there is little recognition of the condition. They want the government to formally recognise the long -term impact of the virus, provide financial support for those unable to work because of long Covid and establish multidisciplinary clinics to help assess and treat patients. Research has only recently begun into the long-term effects of Covid-19, but Shepherd said the working theory was that the coronavirus had disrupted people’s immune systems, causing a cytokine storm, or an overreaction of the body’s protective system, which is thought to also be a factor in ME and chronic fatigue syndrome. “Several studies in the last two or three years show that immune system dysfunction is probably involved in ME,” he said. The immune system seems to continue to activate on a low level, trying to fight off a virus that is no longer there. That reaction may then affect the central nervous system and the hypothalamus. If post-Covid fatigue and ME are linked, research may provide solutions to both conditions. It has been difficult to study ME since most people with the condition have lived with it for months – if a virus was involved, it has left little trace by the time researchers meet their patient. “This is the first time you can follow people almost from day one. Researchers are building large cohorts, they have got blood samples, and they can follow patients almost from the point of infection to when they develop post-viral fatigue. We’ve never had the opportunity to do that before. ” "

    "title": "Covid 19 Masks could boost immunity slow infections study finds Kashmir Today",
    "body": "2020/09/14 - Experts from California university said face masks may provide a vaccine-like effect by generating immunity and slowing the spread of Covid-19 infection. Scientists are comparing face masks to a process called variolation wherein healthy people are exposed to material from the scabs of infected patients in order to increase immunity. Variolation was followed before a vaccine for smallpox was discovered. In a commentary in the New England Journal of Medicine, Monica Gandhi and George W Rutherford of University of California in San Francisco said using masks in the Covid era could achieve similar results. Gandhi and Rutherford concluded that face masks could reduce the viral inoculum (infecting amount of the virus). This they inferred based on long-standing theory that the severity of the disease is proportionate to the viral inoculum. (Photo: AFP) “Since masks filter out some virus-containing droplets (with filtering capacity determined by mask type), masking might reduce the inoculum that an exposed person inhales,” the pair wrote in the journal. Moreover, an experiment conducted on hamsters supported this theory and showed with simulated masking the animals were less likely to get infected, or were either asymptomatic or had milder symptoms than unmasked hamsters. “Universal masking seems to reduce the rate of new infections; we hypothesise that by reducing the rate of new viral infections, it would also decrease the proportion of infected people who remain asymptomatic,” Gandhi and Rutherford wrote. The duo also referred to an outbreak on a closed Argentinian cruise ship where passengers were provided with surgical masks and staff with N95 masks. The rate of asymptomatic infection was 81 per cent on testing compared with 20 per cent in earlier cruise ship outbreaks without universal masking. Dr S K Sarin, director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, said this paper explained how 29 per cent of Delhi were antibody-positive but have never had infection. “Mask may allow a very miniscule amount of virus to enter and provide a vaccine-like effect, leading to antibody formation without true infection,” said Sarin. – Agencies "

    "body": "2020/09/14 - Motorola has lately been giving a tough competition to Chinese smartphone brands. And that may or may not be about the specifications but it is definitely about the number of smartphone launches it seems to have strategised. After the Moto G9 Plus, Motorola has launched a budget smartphone called the Moto E7 Plus. It has launched the new smartphone in Brazil but E7 Plus release could widen to more markets. Moto E7 Plus Price The Moto E7 Plus price is not official yet. Motorola has listed the smartphone on its Brazil website with all the specifications but maybe the price is not something it wants to announce yet. The smartphone will come in Amber Bronze and Navy Blue colours, the website has revealed. Moto E7 Plus Specifications Considering it is a budget smartphone, Motorola has gone for hardware that respects that price bracket. The Moto E7 Plus has a 6. 5-inch HD+ screen with a small notch on the top. The notch carries the front camera that is an 8-megapixel shooter. Powering it is an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 processor paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage, which is expandable further. It runs Android 10 with a few customisations from Motorola. There is a 5000mAh battery under the hood with 10W charging. The cameras at the back include a 48-megapixel snapper with an f1. 7 aperture and a 2-megapixel additional shooter for portrait modes. You also get an LED flash on the back. The Motorola’s batwing logo at the back mounts the physical fingerprint sensor as well. For connectivity, you have Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, 4G VoLTE, a 3. 5mm headphone jack, and a Micro USB port. The Moto E7 Plus weighs 200 grams and measures in at 165. 2x75. 7x9. 2mm. You also have a gyroscope, an accelerometer, and a proximity sensor among others on the Moto E7 Plus. The Moto E7 Plus seems a good rival to smartphones such as Oppo A53 as they both share the processor. This processor has not been reviewed by us so we cannot tell how good it is. But considering Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 4-series, it should be able to handle everyday tasks and moderate gaming. Moreover, a lot of customers will go for the stock Android-like experience that Motorola phones are known for. Apart from Nokia, Motorola devices are the ones that let you have an interface that is similar to Google Pixel’s. "

According to his sources, the dongle will be marketed as “Google Chromecast with Google TV. ” Now Target’s internal system dropped Sabrina’s the price to $49. 99 and renamed it to “Google Chromecast with Google TV” (not Android TV), giving legs to May’s rumor from @9to5Google about the rebranding of Android TV back to Google TV (https://t. co/HV1rfeo4bK). — Artem Russakovskii (@ArtemR) September 12, 2020 He also notes that Target has also dropped the price from $59. 99 to $49. 99, meaning all the retailers now have the same low price. 9to5Google has earlier uncovered a listing for the handset at HomeDepot (now deleted but still in Google’s cache) which lists the device for only $49. 99.

    "title": "iPhone 12 rumors Apple likely to launch new 5G iPhone in October",
    "body": "2020/09/14 - Angela Lang/CNET Apple Event In August, Apple apparently leaked a Sept. 10 event date on its YouTube channel. But recent invitations sent out by the company confirms that it’s holding an online event that’s actually scheduled for Sept. 15. During this presser, we expect Apple to focus on the next Apple Watch Series 6 and new iPads, instead of the new iPhone 12, 12 Pro and 12 Max (Apple has not confirmed the names of the phones, but we’ll go with those for now). That’s because while we usually see new flagship iPhones in September, the COVID-19 outbreak has forced suppliers in China to shut down or operate on limited capacity. This affected not only Apple’s inventory in September, but it may affect sales, too. Apple also closed its US retail stores, though now some have reopened in limited ways. All this culminated with Apple confirming there will be a delay on the iPhone 11 sequels, perhaps as late as October. Our best educated guess for the iPhone 12 announcement is either Oct. 13 or 14. Now playing: Watch this: Will the iPhone 12 arrive on time? Despite such disruptions and Apple’s veil of secrecy, there are some things we do know about the iPhone 12. From what we’ve seen of iOS 14 and its public beta so far, we can expect the phone to have software features like widgets, app libraries and picture-in-picture. Unofficial hardware rumors include 3D depth sensing on its rear cameras and new screen sizes. Adding 5G connectivity would also make sense considering Apple’s main opponent, Samsung, launched several 5G phones this year, including the recent Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra, as well as the flagship Galaxy S20 phones. The later timeline might have some unexpected positive consequences too, including giving carriers like Verizon more time to build out its 5G coverage. Until any of that happens though, check back often as we will continue to update it with the most probable and compelling rumors. And if you’re already planning to get the device, here are three things you can do now to prep for the iPhone 12. Top iPhone 12 rumors Apple said the iPhone 12 will be available “a few weeks later” than the usual mid-September launch. An October release date is possible. There may be four iPhone 12 models in three different screen sizes: the iPhone 12 (5. 4-inch), 12 Max (6. 1-inch), 12 Pro (6. 1-inch) and 12 Pro Max (6. 7-inch). iPhone 12 base model may be cheaper than the iPhone 11’s $699 starting price. iPhone 12 phones may have 5G. iPhone 12 may not come with earbuds or a power adapter. iPhone 12 may come in dark blue. iPhone 12’s rear-facing camera(s) may have 3D depth-sensing technology. Announcement date: Possibly October In what appeared to be a misstep on Apple’s part, a Twitter user posted a screenshot of a possible Apple livestream event scheduled for Sept. 10. The event date and time appeared on Apple’s YouTube page and then was taken down. We now know, however, that Apple is holding an event on Sept. 15, and it most likely won’t be about the iPhone. This still leaves the date of the iPhone 12 announcement up in the air. Another mobile leaker and Front Page Tech host Jon Prosser reported that the iPhone 12 will be introduced during an Oct. 12 event and will ship out Oct. 19, for instance. Apple Release date: iPhone 12 may not ship out until October Despite Apple’s largest manufacturer, Foxconn, assuring investors it should still make its fall timeline, The Wall Street Journal reported that the iPhone 12 could face delays. This is due to the coronavirus pandemic and its unprecedented effect on manufacturing and consumer demands. The report estimated that Apple may wait until October to announce or launch the phone, which is about a month after the iPhone’s usual launch. Apple CFO Luca Maestri all but confirmed this on a quarterly earnings call, saying, “This year, we project supply to be available a few weeks later” than last year’s mid-September launch. Others have suggested not a single launch date but several. A rumor floated by DigiTimes and picked up by MacRumors, suggested that Apple may launch its 2020 iPhones in multiple stages. The two 6. 1-inch iPhone models may launch first, with the 6. 7- and 5. 4-inch variants coming later. (For more on the different speculated iPhone sizes, read more below. ) Price: iPhone 12 may be cheaper than iPhone 11 When the iPhone 11 debuted last year, we were pleasantly surprised that its base model cost $699, which was $50 cheaper than 2018’s iPhone XR. This trend may continue, with one tech analyst reporting that Apple will price the iPhone 12 at $649, the iPhone 12 Pro at $999 and the iPhone 12 Pro Max at $1,099. 5G: iPhone 12 may have next-gen connectivity Several rumors are predicting that Apple will include 5G connectivity this year. More specifically, Apple analyst Ming-chi Kuo expects the company to unveil three 5G phones, and Fast Company reported that Apple may use its own proprietary 5G antennas. There are a couple of reasons why the company didn’t jump on the trend in 2019. First, Apple usually isn’t the first in on mobile trends, preferring instead to perfect an emerging technology before committing to it. For example, it was behind its competitors in making phones with 3G and 4G LTE connectivity when those networks just launched. Second, Apple stopped working with the leading 5G modem provider, Qualcomm, because of a dispute over Qualcomm’s licensing fees. The two companies settled their litigation in April 2019, and then agreed to a multiyear 5G chip deal. This led to Apple’s previous partner of 5G modems, Intel, to ultimately exit the 5G phone modem business altogether and Apple later acquired Intel’s smartphone modem business for $1 billion. Apple is still working with Qualcomm, but it got started too late to launch a 5G phone last year when a few of its rivals released their 5G models, like the Galaxy S10 5G, LG V50 5G and OnePlus 7 Pro 5G. Whatever its start date though, Apple releasing a 5G phone is notable not only because the phone will be able to connect to the next-gen network, but also because this standout feature won’t be entirely under Apple’s control. 5G networks are built by carriers and Apple is taking a risk because users all across the country will have different experiences on this nascent network depending on their coverage. Design: iPhone 12 may be similar (or not) to iPhone 11 Every other year, Apple usually makes notable cosmetic changes to its iPhone to freshen up its look, much to the delight of anticipating buyers. But a report by Japanese publication Mac Otakara, citing an unnamed Chinese supplier, reported that the iPhone 12 will look similar to the iPhone 11. The only possible difference is that the iPhone 12’s edges will be slightly bowed. On the other hand, Apple is also speculated to completely revamp the iPhone’s design with flat edges (similar to the new iPads). This could trigger what Wedbush analyst Dan Ives called “the perfect storm of demand,” which would drive up sales and result in a “super cycle” for Apple. Accessories: iPhone 12 may not come with EarPods or a power adapter In one of the more unpopular rumors, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported that Apple may not include its wired EarPod headphones in the iPhone 12 box. This would be a move to encourage people to buy the company’s wireless AirPods instead. Apple has included EarPod headphones since the iPhone 5 release in 2012, so this would be a notable change. AirPod and AirPod Pro earbuds are currently priced at $159 (£159, AU$249) and $249 (£249, AU$399), respectively. Angela Lang/CNET Ming-Chi Kuo expects that the iPhone 12 will ship without a power adapter as well, according to 9to5Mac. The reason is mainly for costs – by foregoing it, Apple can keep costs down while loading the phone with 5G components. It would also help lower freight costs as the size of the packaging would shrink. Apple wouldn’t be alone in the change. Samsung’s Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra also don’t come with headphones – though if you really need a pair, Samsung will send them for free. But unlike the power adapter rumor, the Note phones still come with a charger in the box. Processor: iPhone 12 will likely have A14 Bionic Given that the latest iPhones have the A13 Bionic processor, it is highly probable that the next proprietary chipset will be called the A14 Bionic. And like every year, we expect this one to be faster and more efficient than its predecessor. More specifically however, one Apple leaker on Twitter, Komiya, reported that the A14 will have a CPU gain of 40% and a GPU gain of 50%. Colors: iPhone 12 Pro may come in dark blue Last year Apple introduced a midnight green color on the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max. Whether you like the shade or not, the color variant actually sold well compared to expectations. This year there may be a possibility that Apple will launch another new color, navy blue, on the iPhone 12 Pro according to XDA Developer. This would be on trend since blue is both Pantone’s color pick for the new year (“classic blue”) and Shutterstock included “phantom blue” in its color forecast for 2020. EverythingApplePro Specs and display: Four possible iPhone 12 models One of the more enduring rumors about the upcoming iPhones is that Apple may introduce new screen sizes. One of the iPhone 12s could have a 5. 4-inch screen (of the current iPhones, the new iPhone SE has the smallest display, which measures 4. 7 inches). And the iPhone 2020 Pro Max could go as large as 6. 7 inches (for reference, the iPhone 11 Pro Max has a 6. 5-inch display). There’s also speculation that the iPhone 12’s display will have a 120Hz refresh rate and that perhaps the iPhone 12 Pro may have a ProMotion display, which is currently featured on the iPad Pro. Most phones refresh at 60 frames per second, or 60Hz, but other phones, like the Galaxy S20 and the OnePlus 8 Pro refresh at 120Hz. With a higher refresh rate, a phone feels faster and smoother when scrolling through things like web pages and apps. Phone Arena With the possibility of new display sizes, rumors that Apple will expand its iPhone line have been swirling around. In December 2019, CNET’s Lexy Savvides wrote: According to JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee, Apple will release four new iPhone 12 models in the fall of 2020: a 5. 4-inch model, two 6. 1-inch phones and a 6. 7-inch phone. All of them will have OLED displays. These size predictions were also backed this week by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who believes the current 5. 8-inch size of the iPhone 11 Pro may be going away. So the 5. 4-inch and one of the 6. 1-inch models will be the lower-end devices, presumably called the iPhone 12. Then the more expensive phones will be the other 6. 1-inch and 6. 7-inch iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, respectively.

Camera: iPhone 12 may have 3D depth sensing Since the iPhone X, newer iPhones have front-facing cameras that have 3D depth sensing. Known as Face ID, this feature scans your face for unlocking your phone and authorizing digital payments. It’s been rumored that Apple may take it up a notch and introduce that same system to the rear cameras. In August 2019, CNET’s Vanessa Orellana wrote: Longtime Apple analyst Ming Chi Kuo (via MacRumors and 9to5Mac) said he expects two of the 2020 iPhones models to have a new time-of-flight camera lens on the back of the phone. The setup would be similar to that of the current True Depth camera system used for Face ID on the front of the phone, except it would use a slightly different type of technology that could allow it to 3D map objects from farther away. This would significantly improve its augmented reality applications and take certain camera features like Portrait Mode to the next level. Renders of the iPhone’s camera array integrating the depth-sensing lens have been circulating, with many online commenters remarking how the iPhone 12’s possible camera layout looks similar to a stovetop.

    "title": "Apple eases in app purchase restrictions for online game streaming Report",
    "body": "2020/09/14 - Tech goliath Apple has eased its App Store guidelines for iPad and iPhone users, and will now not charge the 15-30 percent fee for all app downloads, in-app purchases and subscriptions. While small, the changes made on September 11 suggest Apple is willing to listen to app makers’ complaints against stringent rules, Bloomberg reported. The biggest impact is likely to be seen in the streaming video games market, where for the first time Apple will approve games directly from the web as opposed to only those via installed apps. Previously, complaints were raised by Google, Nvidia Corporation and Microsoft Corporation, who challenged unavailability of their streaming services on Apple devices while Apple’s own Arcade was freely available. The new leeway is however still limited. Games will have to be submitted individually for Apple’s platforms instead of an “all-you-can-eat” service, but still potentially gives users access to a wider variety of titles currently unavailable. So while it does hinder a company’s ability to offer broad streaming games service, it makes workarounds possible. “Streaming games are permitted so long as they adhere to all guidelines — for example, each game update must be submitted for review, developers must provide appropriate metadata for search, games must use in-app purchase to unlock features or functionality,” Apple’s statement to developers said. Google declined to comment, as per the report, while Microsoft maintained it “remains a bad experience for customers. ” “Gamers want to jump directly into a game from their curated catalogue within one app just like they do with movies or songs, and not be forced to download over 100 apps to play individual games from the cloud,” Microsoft spokesperson told Bloomberg. Besides gaming apps, online teaching apps will also now be allowed in-app purchases for tutoring and work-outs – but limited to between two people. This is an improvement over the 30 percent class revenue earlier paid by developers including ClassPass, Airbnb and Facebook. E-mail apps are another winner, with in-app purchase rules tweaked and more free accounts allowed. However, Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games, which is embroiled in a legal dispute with Apple over circumvention of App Store guidelines said the move will not impact the tech giant’s “grip on the mobile gaming business,” according to the report.

    "body": "2020/09/14 - Jason Cipriani/CNET Android 11 is ready for your phone, as long as it’s compatible. And if it isn’t yet, it could be soon – phone brands will want to fast-track Google’s new operating system for their top phones. The Android 11 update brings a slew of new features, including a screen to control your connected devices, redesigned media controls, improved notifications and a new messaging feature called Bubbles, which you’ll either love or hate. As is usually the case with major Android updates, how soon you’ll receive the update depends on who makes your device. Google has said that Android 11 is rolling out to its Pixel 2 and newer phones in that range, along with OnePlus, Xiaomi, Oppo and Realme phones right now. Own a Pixel? You’re a few taps away from Android 11 Open the Settings app on your phone and, on a Pixel phone at least, tap System &gt; Advanced &gt; System update &gt; Check for update. If your phone doesn’t find the update right away, be patient. As is always the case with Google, the update is slowly rolling out, so it might take a few days before it shows up on your phone – just keep checking. Once your phone finds the update, just follow the prompts to install it like you would any other update. I recommend having your phone plugged into a charger and a strong Wi-Fi connection to ensure the process is as smooth as possible. Jason Cipriani/CNET There’s an open beta for the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro If you have a OnePlus 8 or OnePlus 8 Pro, the company has launched an open beta of its OxygenOS 11 update, which includes Android 11. Anyone who wants to check out the new features before it’s officially released needs to visit the OnePlus forums, where instructions and details are posted. The installation process won’t force you to reset your device or lose any data, but it is a beta, so proceed with caution. I installed the update on a OnePlus 8, following the steps outlined in the post, and it took around 30 minutes to complete. You can download the file directly on your OnePlus phone and use the OnePlus file manager app to move it to the root storage folder, or download it on your computer and transfer the file to your phone in order to install it. You can go back to a more stable version of OxygenOS if there are too many issues with the beta, but be warned, that will wipe all data from your phone. Screenshots by Jason Cipriani/CNET What about Nokia, Xiaomi, Oppo? Not every phone-maker has publicly announced their rollout plans for Android 11, but we do know that Nokia has confirmed it will release Android 11. Oppo will officially announce its ColorOS 11 update on Sept. 14 via a livestream, and has also opened a limited beta for the Find X2, Find X2 Pro, Reno3 (4G) and Reno3 Pro (4G). Xiaomi posted on Twitter that the Mi 10 and Mi 10 Pro would be the first devices to get Android 11, and the company has also launched a beta program for early adopters. We will continue to update this list as more device-makers announce their plans for rolling out Android 11 to their respective phones. What do you do if you were in the public beta? You shouldn’t have to do anything special if you’ve been testing Android 11 on a Pixel phone through Google’s public beta program. Once the update is available for your phone, you’ll update to the official version of Android 11 and “graduate” from the beta program. You can double-check that you’re no longer enrolled in the beta program on the beta website: Your device should say “Opt in” under it. I’ve been testing Android 11 for a while now, and have found some features that will change the way you use your phone. There’s also some significant improvements to privacy features included in the update. For more general, but still just as great, Android tricks, check out these hidden features. "

    "body": "2020/09/14 - Why is the world all of a sudden blocking the doors for PUBG. The super success story of world of Esport and mobile gaming has suddenly started becoming throne in the eyes of many countries. The PUBG promoters had recently revealed that it had crossed over 40 million daily active users. But the world’s most popular mobile game has been slapped with a ban not only in India but many other countries. China, Jordan, Nepal, Israel, Iraq and India have banned PUBG with-in their borders. Eyebrows are being raised in many other countries against PUBG and preparations are being made to ban PUBG there as well. PUBG Ban : Why world has started standing against PUBG ? According to the experts following the trend, the primary reason authorities world over has started standing against PUBG is 3 fold – 1) PUBG is too addictive. This results in younger generation devoting too much time on their screens and that has resulted students neglecting their careers, studies and develop mental and physical disorders. It disrupts gamers sleep pattern and disrupts physical and mental health. 2) PUBG makers have acted irresponsibly according to some experts. Today even Apple, Facebook and all others constantly informs users about their screen times, ill effects of the same – PUBG according to experts act irresponsibly and operates without any warning mechanism. 3) Few feel, PUBG propagates violence. This is the reason most of the countries today are deliberating on banning gaming addiction caused by PUBG. PUBG BAN : India banned PUBG for altogether different reasons Few Indian states had banned PUBG even before the Government of India decided to ban PUBG in the entire country in wake of Anti-China wave. The GOI more than 118 Chinese mobile applications list, including PUBG Mobile, PUBG Mobile Lite, Baidu, WeChat to counter the threat posed by these applications to the country’s “sovereignty and security”. These applications are also said to cause problems to state security and public order in “This decision is a target that must be achieved for the safety of the state, security, and sovereignty of the Indian cyberspace,” said the Indian IT Ministry. PUBG Ban : Indian government ‘unlikely’ to reverse ban on PUBG anytime soon The Indian government is ‘unlikely’ to overturn PUBG (PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds) ban anytime soon. The South Korean owners of PUBG snapped ties with Tencent in Indian to get things back on track in its biggest market. But the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is in no mood to relent. InsideSport has learnt from its sources in the ministry, that the India government will not overturn the PUBG ban just by mere announcement of the change of the ownership in the country. According to the ministry sources, Indian government is deeply concerned about various other issues attached to the app and until or unless that is not addressed, PUBG ban will not be reversed. “Along with ownership issues, we are concerned about data of the users and various other points related to these apps. No ban reversal decision will be taken until or unless those are addressed”, told one of the ministry source to InsideSport. "

    "body": "2020/09/14 - New Delhi: by Anurag KotokyIndia’s space program wants to go where no nation has gone before -– to the south side of the moon . And once it gets there, it will study the potential for mining a source of waste-free nuclear energy that could be worth trillions of dollars. The nation’s equivalent of NASA will launch a rover in October to explore virgin territory on the lunar surface and analyze crust samples for signs of water and helium-3. That isotope is limited on Earth yet so abundant on the moon that it theoretically could meet global energy demands for 250 years if harnessed. “The countries which have the capacity to bring that source from the moon to Earth will dictate the process,’’ said K. Sivan, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation. “I don’t want to be just a part of them, I want to lead them. ’’The mission would solidify India’s place among the fleet of explorers racing to the moon, Mars and beyond for scientific, commercial or military gains. The governments of the U. S. , China, India, Japan and Russia are competing with startups and billionaires Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson to launch satellites, robotic landers, astronauts and tourists into the cosmos. The rover landing is one step in an envisioned series for ISRO that includes putting a space station in orbit and, potentially, an Indian crew on the moon. The government has yet to set a timeframe. “We are ready and waiting,’’ said Sivan, an aeronautics engineer who joined ISRO in 1982. “We’ve equipped ourselves to take on this particular program. ’’China is the only country to put a lander and rover on the moon this century with its Chang’e 3 mission in 2013. The nation plans to return later this year by sending a probe to the unexplored far side. In the U. S. , President Donald Trump signed a directive calling for astronauts to return to the moon, and NASA’s proposed $19 billion budget this fiscal year calls for launching a lunar orbiter by the early 2020s. ISRO’s estimated budget is less than a 10th of that – about $1. 7 billion – but accomplishing feats on the cheap has been a hallmark of the agency since the 1960s. The upcoming mission will cost about $125 million – or less than a quarter of Snap Inc. co-founder Evan Spiegel’s compensation last year, the highest for an executive of a publicly traded company, according to the Bloomberg Pay Index. This won’t be India’s first moon mission. The Chandrayaan-1 craft, launched in October 2008, completed more than 3,400 orbits and ejected a probe that discovered molecules of water in the surface for the first time. The upcoming launch of Chandrayaan-2 includes an orbiter, lander and a rectangular rover. The six-wheeled vehicle, powered by solar energy, will collect information for at least 14 days and cover an area with a 400-meter radius. The rover will send images to the lander, and the lander will transmit those back to ISRO for analysis. A primary objective, though, is to search for deposits of helium-3. Solar winds have bombarded the moon with immense quantities of helium-3 because it’s not protected by a magnetic field like Earth is. The presence of helium-3 was confirmed in moon samples returned by the Apollo missions, and Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmitt, a geologist who walked on the moon in December 1972, is an avid proponent of mining helium-3. “It is thought that this isotope could provide safer nuclear energy in a fusion reactor, since it is not radioactive and would not produce dangerous waste products,’’ the European Space Agency said. There are an estimated 1 million metric tons of helium-3 embedded in the moon, though only about a quarter of that realistically could be brought to Earth, said Gerald Kulcinski, director of the Fusion Technology Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a former member of the NASA Advisory Council. That’s still enough to meet the world’s current energy demands for at least two, and possibly as many as five, centuries, Kulcinski said. He estimated helium-3’s value at about $5 billion a ton, meaning 250,000 tons would be worth in the trillions of dollars. To be sure, there are numerous obstacles to overcome before the material can be used – including the logistics of collection and delivery back to Earth and building fusion power plants to convert the material into energy. Those costs would be stratospheric. “If that can be cracked, India should be a part of that effort,’’ said Lydia Powell, who runs the Centre for Resources Management at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation think tank. “If the cost makes sense, it will become a game-changer, no doubt about it. ’’Plus, it won’t be easy to mine the moon. Only the U. S. and Luxembourg have passed legislation allowing commercial entities to hold onto what they have mined from space, said David Todd, head of space content at Northampton, England-based Seradata Ltd. There isn’t any international treaty on the issue. “Eventually, it will be like fishing in the sea in international waters,’’ Todd said. “While a nation-state cannot hold international waters, the fish become the property of its fishermen once fished. ’’India’s government is reacting to the influx of commercial firms in space by drafting legislation to regulate satellite launches, company registrations and liability, said GV Anand Bhushan, a Chennai-based partner at the Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas &amp; Co. law firm. It doesn’t cover moon mining. Yet the nation’s only spaceman isn’t fully on board with turning the moon into a place of business. Rakesh Sharma, who spent almost eight days aboard a Russian spacecraft in 1984, said nations and private enterprises instead should work together to develop human colonies elsewhere as Earth runs out of resources and faces potential catastrophes such as asteroid strikes. “You can’t go to the moon and draw boundaries,’’ Sharma said. “I want India to show that we’re capable of utilizing space technology for the good of people. ’’ "

Billionaire entrepreneur and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk’s plan to bombard the Martian polar caps to terraform the planet through release of carbon dioxide will require launching more than 10,000 nuclear warheads, Russia’s space agency Roscosmos Executive Director for Science and Long-Term Programs Alexander Bloshenko said in an interview with TASS. “If briefly analyzed, certain plans put forward by SpaceX simply cannot be implemented taking into account the short-term technological developments. For example, for a thermonuclear explosion on Mars’ pole, one of the plans of SpaceX, to have tangible results, more than 10,000 launches of missiles that can carry the largest payloads and are being developed now are needed,” he noted. Earlier, Musk proposed an ambitious idea to terraform Mars by bombarding the planet’s poles with a large number of nuclear weapons. According to the SpaceX CEO, the explosions will release trapped carbon dioxide that makes up the Martian “ice” caps. The released gas will thicken the planet’s atmosphere, triggering greenhouse gas effect and eventually raising the Martian temperatures.

    "body": "2020/09/14 - Even an ordinary vacuum cleaner can become a pathogen of ticks and infections. Oksana Radko Wellness / Travel section editor House cleaning is seemingly common everyday business, but it can be harmful to human health. As well as things that we use every day in everyday life. How to properly clean the house for the benefit of yourself and your loved ones, and what everyday habits can inflict an inevitable blow to the human body, have been found out in the program “Ranks with Ukraine”. How to clean your health For example, a detergent sprayed on the surface of furniture creates a thin film invisible to the human eye, which is like a magnet for dust and dirt – everything adheres to it much faster. And applying the product to a napkin reduces concentration. Also, this method is considered safer for the human body. “Small particles that hang in the air for a long time are toxic irritants, because they are chemical structures. They can irritate the mucous membranes of the nose, bronchi, and eyes,” says allergist Elena Bachinskaya. Vacuuming does not mean cleaning. If you have a regular vacuum cleaner and do not clean the bag after each cleaning, then it becomes a pathogen of ticks and infections. And the longer the vacuum cleaner is with a dirty bag, the more hazardous substances it gets. “When you turn on the vacuum cleaner again in a week, it will blow out the smallest microscopic particles that cannot be retained by filters with a powerful jet. And then they will hang in the air for a long time, because they are very small and light,” says the doctor. , then you should give preference to wet cleaning. And it is better to choose a vacuum cleaner that will filter the debris through the water. That is, you vacuumed, poured water, and it costs clean. ” How to clean your health Making the bed is the last thing to do in the morning. After all, after waking up, dirt remains on it, which the human eye does not see. You need to wait a little until the bed cools down and ventilate the room. “Each of us exfoliates 3-4 million epidermal cells every hour,” explains the allergist. “This is the main breeding ground for house dust mites. ” Also, do not leave wet terry towels in the bathroom. This is because they become a favorable environment for the spread of fungal infections. Therefore, these towels should be changed every two days. And for the face it is better to use disposable in general. Another tip is not to keep the curtains open all the time in summer. This primarily concerns people who have rooms on the sunny side. If you want the furniture and the floor to stay presentable for as long as possible, you should close the windows with curtains or blinds during daylight hours. Due to the high amount of UV radiation, furniture and wood floors can quickly lose their color.

    "body": "2020/09/14 - A cardiac MRI is effective in identifying inflammation of the heart muscle in athletes and can help determine when those who have recovered from COVID-19 can safely return to play in competitive sports, according to a new study by researchers at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. The research is published online in JAMA Cardiology. Ohio State researchers examined 26 COVID-19 positive male and female competitive college athletes for signs of myocarditis, a rare disease that can cause heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Most cases of myocarditis, which is usually caused by a viral infection, happen in young adults with males affected more than females. Recent studies have shown myocardial inflammation in patients who recovered from COVID-19. Twelve of the athletes studied by Ohio State researchers reported mild symptoms of COVID-19 and the rest were asymptomatic. Recently published protocols recommend the use of a combination of clinical examination, echocardiogram (an ultrasound), electrocardiogram (records a heartbeat) and a blood test to help with diagnosis of myocarditis in athletes prior to return to competitive play. The Ohio State researchers used all of these methods as well as cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, which they found to be effective in identifying myocardial inflammation not picked up by other methods. This is the first study to systematically investigate the use of CMR imaging in competitive athletes recovered from COVID-19 infection. CMR has the potential to identify a high-risk group for adverse outcomes and may, importantly, risk stratify athletes for safe participation, as CMR mapping techniques have a high negative predictive value to rule out myocarditis. ” Dr. Saurabh Rajpal, cardiologist and assistant professor in the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine at The Ohio State University College of Medicine In the study, four athletes (15%) were shown to possibly have myocarditis by MRI criteria. In addition to these four, eight others had evidence of scar tissue, suggesting either prior myocardial injury or normal athletic adaptation of the heart. “It’s not known what caused the scar tissue in those eight, or if it was related to having COVID-19,” Rajpal said. “Additionally, the CMR imaging ruled out myocarditis for all athletes without MRI evidence of inflammation, allowing them to return to playing sports. ” Myocarditis can happen to anyone, not just athletes. “The public should be aware of these findings and know the symptoms of heart disease with COVID-19 infection. As people begin to exercise after recovering from the virus, any chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heart beats should be evaluated by a doctor,” said Dr. Curt Daniels, co-author, cardiologist and professor at Ohio State Wexner Medical Center. The study’s authors recommend more research on CMR screening, including long-term follow-ups with athletes and control populations. "

Is it normal for your dog’s nose to feel this way? The answer is yes, it is normal. But especially warm noses after drowsiness, said Anna Bálint, a researcher studying animal behavior at the University of Eötvös Loránd in Budapest, Hungary. “When a dog sleeps, it usually warms and drys his nose,” she told Live Science. Then the dog wakes up, licks his nose and catches a cold again. But why is a dog’s nose cold and beneficial? relation : Are the dogs really laughing at us? One idea is that a dog’s cold nose can help furry animals regulate their body temperature. But the tip of the nose is too small to make a meaningful contribution to the dog’s overall temperature control, Bálint said. For further investigation, the international team of scientists Nose temperature in many animals , Horse, dog and moose included. When Bálint was involved in the project, the team already found out that dogs and predators’ nose tips or rhinos were generally cooler than herbivores. Perhaps a cooler nose tip could be an advantage in the wild, the researchers thought. The research team conducted two experiments. One looked at the behavior and the other examined the brain to see if the cold linarium could do better heat detection. In the first experiment, the team successfully trained three dogs, allowing them to choose a warmer object at about the same temperature as the potential prey over an object at room temperature. The results indicate that the dog can detect weak thermal radiation at a distance similar to that of prey. Second, in a brain-centric investigation, scientists presented insulated doors to 13 dogs trained to lie down in a box of warm water and functionality. MRI scanner . The dog’s brain was more responsive when the insulated door was opened, revealing a warmer surface compared to the neutral one. The illuminated area on the MRI is only in the left hemisphere. Bálint says it’s attracting scientists’ attention because this side of the brain tends to process reactions to food, Bálint said. Certain areas of light in dogs (called the somatosensory cortex) help to gather a variety of sensations such as vision, body position, and warmth, he added. This part of the brain combines these sensations simultaneously to plan actions towards a goal, such as targeting an object. Given that this left nerve area is brightened when the tip of the nose is exposed to a warm surface, dogs and other cold nosed animals can use the heat sensing sensation along with other sensations in the’hunting toolbox’. ‘As they chase prey, the researchers said. Although a recent study was published in the journal February 2020 Scientific report Bálint said it was too small to close the case tightly with a cold nose, Bálint said a cold nose could be more sensitive to temperature differences. “People think that the dog follows the sense of smell [sense of smell]Bálint is probably really true. However, windy conditions or stormy weather can make it difficult for a working dog to keep up with the smell. “The heat signal can help them. ” So, why is your dog’s nose cold? Bálint and her team are constantly looking for answers to this question. Now they are wondering at what distances this type of heat sensing could be useful. Now I only know the nose of a dog.

The specialist advises to pay attention to them, but in this matter you need to be careful, observing harmony. Women with a dense physique need to choose wide-brimmed hats, since they will correspond to their complexion, and for the fair sex of short stature, it is better to choose a small hat. Closed shoes should be worn in autumn. You can opt not only for leather products, but also for those made of rubber. An umbrella at this time of the year is also a very important accessory with which you can highlight your individuality.

    "title": "Space Stations of the Past Present and Future",
    "body": "2020/09/14 - Did you know that, to date, 240 individuals from 19 countries have visited the International Space Station (ISS)? Or the fact that the ISS makes 16 orbits around the Earth every 24 hours? Or that you can look up in the sky at dawn or dusk and catch a glimpse of the space station flying past your home even if you live in a big city. The International Space Station is a symbol of human ingenuity and the aspirational goal to live beyond our own planet eventually. However, the spacecraft serves a much bigger purpose than a home for the astronauts. Doubling as a floating science lab, in the more than 18 years of crewed operation, thousands of researchers on the ground in more than 100 countries have conducted more than 2,500 experiments in microgravity. That number continues to grow. These experiments directly impact our lives here on planet Earth. There are manufacturing, medical, biological, and technological innovations taking place there that would not be possible here on Earth. Space stations make our lives better here on Earth Scientific research has played an important role in shaping the ISS’s purpose and expansion. The ISS’ days are numbered though. NASA is currently planning to end its support of the ISS by 2024, transitioning the aging space lab to the private sector and for-profit activities, like manufacturing, marketing, advertising, and space tourism. After 2024, we can expect to see the space station reducing its operations significantly. Whether it is in 2030 or 2050, the ISS will eventually make its way back down to Earth. Though some parts of the space station will be kept in orbit, NASA plans to bring it down safely, rather than leaving it to plummet SkyLab-style. But this won’t be easy or cheap. The space agency has estimated that it will take $950 million and two years to bring the station down to Earth. Where? Currently, the expected resting place of the ISS will be in the most remote spot on the planet, Point Nemo, in the Pacific Ocean. NASA estimates that somewhere between 53,500 and 173,250 pounds (24,250-78,500kg) of the space station will drop into the ocean. So, what’s next? The coming end of the ISS will probably see the development of the next generation of space stations from both the public and private sectors. Space stations will move beyond acting primarily as laboratories and will play a much larger role in space exploration, economic development, commerce, and even your tourism. However, to understand the space stations of the future, you should understand the space stations of the past. Space Stations go back to the 19th century Noordung Space Station Source: Herman Potočnik/Wikimedia Space stations, or at least the concept of space station, is not that new of an idea. The term space station was coined by Hermann Oberth, a Romanian Rocket pioneer, which would eventually be blueprinted and modeled by the Austrian Herman Noordung in 1928. The platform the team envisioned would serve as a starting point for missions to the Moon and Mars. Noordung and Oberth’s visions saw large rockets taking their craft into orbit. However, references to space stations go back even further in history. Some of the earliest concepts of a space station appeared as the early 19th century in our favorite genre, science fiction. Readers of the Atlantic Monthly in 1869 were presented with descriptions of a 200-foot (60 mt) diameter brick sphere, designed to orbit the Earth as a navigational aid to ships, in Edward Everett Hale’s “The Brick Moon. ” Interestingly, unlike our ISS, this brick moon was sent into orbit by accident, with Hale exploring what life on this space station would like in his tales. Disney and Wernher von Braun designed a space station concept Wernher von Braun has been widely described as the father of rocket science, and his work directly shaped both warfare and our modern space program. Post-WWII, Braun would be described as a “spaceflight popularizer” in the United States for more than just his powerful rockets. In an unlikely collaboration with Collier’s Magazine and Walt Disney on the Tomorrowland TV series, Braun would share his vision of a wheel-shaped space station to the public. 2019 conceptual rendering of the proposed Von Braun Space Station Source: Timothy Alatorre/Wikimedia Looking like something out of a modern-day science fiction film, his wheel-shaped orbital was ambitious, to say the least. The toroidal space station would act as an Earth observation post, a microgravity laboratory, and a starting point for missions to the Moon and Mars. The 100-Man Space Base from the 1960s almost came into fruition Real steps towards an actual space station would not start appearing until the late 1950s. Rushing to get a man to the moon, NASA was then considering building a working space station as a follow-up. America wanted technological dominance in space. However, this interest in orbital living quarters above the Earth waned as the journey to the moon became a top priority. Still, in 1969, NASA proposed a 100-man space station called Space Base. The space agency wanted to create a place that could double as a homeport for nuclear-powered space tugs. However, the expected cost and maintenance of such an engineering project was no easy feat. NASA would also need a shuttle from Earth that would ferry supplies to the Space Base. In the future, this part of the plan would emerge as the Space Shuttle. Salyut 1 was the first very first space station In the meantime, NASA decided to pursue a more temporary idea of an orbiting space station. But the Soviet Union would launch the first space station on April 19, 1971. Dubbed the Salyut 1, it orbited around the Earth almost 3,000 times during its 175 days in space. The 65 feet (20 mt) long, 13 feet (4 mt) wide station was cylindrical in shape and consisted of three pressurized compartments for astronauts, and one unpressurized area containing the engines and control equipment. SEE ALSO: NASA INVESTIGATES POSSIBLE AIR LEAK ON THE ISS Though the station was plagued with a host of problems, the mistakes made by the Soviet Union informed the rest of the world about how to properly approach orbital space stations. A little over a decade later, the Soviet Union launched the first part of their much larger space station, Mir. This space station could only have three operators at once. Taking ten years to assemble fully, Mir would grow in size and orbit the Earth more than 86,000 times over the course of fifteen years. Mir retired in 2001, crashing into the South Pacific Ocean, two years after the first pieces of the ISS were launched into space. NASA’s Skylab was never intended to be a long-term space station Astronaut Charles Conrad Jr in the interior of the Skylab. Source: NASA Skylab is considered to be NASA’s first official long-term space station. However, this was never originally the plan. Skylab was born out of excess Apollo hardware from three canceled lunar missions. NASA then took these parts and turned them into the space station, repurposing an S-IVB upper stage and launched it on the last Saturn V in May of 1973. The space station would go on to host three crews. Eventually, it reentered the Earth’s atmosphere and scattered debris over the Indian Ocean and parts of Western Australia in July of 1979. However, the station had demonstrated the feasibility of living and conducting research in space. The ISS is a historic accomplishment 1998 American-built International Space Station Module Launches Source: NASA The first pieces of the ISS were launched in 1998 as a joint project between the United States, Japan, Canada, Russia, and the European Space Agency (ESA); astronauts from more than 15 countries have since visited the station. The first crew for the space station arrived on November 2, 2000. Continually expanding, the ISS has the volume of a five-bedroom house, or two Boeing 747 jetliners. It can support a crew of six people, plus visitors, and includes laboratory modules from the United States, Russia, Japan, and Europe. These laboratory modules have conducted a variety of very important scientific studies. The ISS experiments are helping us back home by supporting water purification efforts worldwide, developing improved vaccines, providing students opportunities to conduct their science in space, and monitoring natural disasters from space, just to name a few. Future space stations will have spider robots and 3D printers Space Stations post-2030 could serve a host of purposes. They might be important laboratories, checkpoints for astronauts headed to the moon and Mars, places of business, tourist spots, and potentially even factories. We could well see space stations from the private sector, too. There are currently five privately-funded, space-station projects in development, the most prominent coming from Bigelow Aerospace and Axiom Space. Aside from shuttling the super-rich to space, nations who do not have the resources to build and maintain their own space station could rent facilities in these to conduct their own research. This is likely to be just the beginning. Technologies like 3D-printing, robotics, and AI could very literally take over space stations, requiring fewer people to crew the orbiting spacecraft. 3D-printers could churn out cheap, functional satellites from the station and launch them into deep space. Spider-like robots could help build and repair the floating habitats in real-time. Smaller laboratory modules may not even need humans at all. "

    "title": "Greenland and Antarctica are losing ice six times faster than predicted by climate change",
    "body": "2020/09/14 - The worst-case scenario for climate change is playing out, and sea level rise is increasing 1. 7mm per year, which will make flooding much more common for the next century. The worst climate change scenario is beginning to play out, and that is that the rates of ice sheet mass loss in Greenland and Antarctica they coincide with the worst estimates and that should be of great concern to the rest of the world. Not only are we not meeting the objectives of curbing as much as possible the increase in temperatures due to climate change in this century, but it seems that we are venturing into the worst possible scenario, something that could change the way in which human beings will live to the next century. And it is that the latest estimates affirm that both Greenland and Antarctica they’re losing ice six times faster than the 1990s. Specifically in this new study published in Nature Climate Change, it is noted that the loss of ice has reached 6. 4 billion tons between 1992 and 2017. This would represent a rise in global sea level by 17. 8 mm, more than enough to make life unsustainable in certain coastal parts of the world where decades ago it was possible to live and now it is not viable. To reach that conclusion, the international team of 89 scientists used observational data spanning three decades to produce a unique estimate of ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica. This study thus compares the results of the mass balance of the ice sheet from satellite observations with projections from climate models. Scientists began monitoring ice sheets in the early 1990s, and since then Greenland and Antarctica combined have lost 6. 4 billion tons of ice from 1992 to 2017. If that trend continues, sea ​​level rise is expected to exceed 1. 7 cm exposing 16 million people to constant flooding by 2100. The observation is possible thanks to the different satellites that are the only means that scientists have to constantly monitor vast areas of the planet. “Satellite observations not only tell how much ice is being lost, but they also help us identify and understand which parts of Antarctica and Greenland are losing ice and through what processes. ”, Says the professor Tom slater, lead author of the study and climate researcher at the Center for Polar Modeling and Observation at the University of Leeds in the UK. Climate change will hit some areas of the planet more violently than others, especially developing countries and the poorest areas. Since 1901, the loss of ice in Greenland and Antarctica, together with other events such as the melting of different glaciers and ice caps, has caused the global sea level to rise 1. 7 mm per year. If nothing is done to remedy it, and there is less and less time, scientists say that sea level rise will affect more than 95% of the world’s oceans by 2100, and that 70% of the coasts will experience a rise in sea level.

The mission will regularly take pictures and partially transmit them to Earth to “create a smooth image,” while the originals will be stored in a return capsule headed back to Earth. This should also help visualize the spacecraft’s behavior by combining camera info with flight data. It could help operate the spacecraft, JAXA said. The MMX spacecraft is expected to launch in Japan’s fiscal 2024 and reach Mars by fiscal 2025. It’ll be longer still before the return capsule arrives. It could be worth the wait. MMX should not only provide highly detailed photography of Mars from above the surface, but land on Phobos and collect surface material. Scientists may learn more about Mars’ past and present. It could also be a treasure trove for NHK — the media giant would have 8K footage that other TV providers could never hope to record themselves. "

    "title": "How women and the moon intertwine in literature",
    "body": "2020/09/14 - In the late 17th century, the female English playwright Aphra Behn wrote a smash hit play about a man obsessed with the moon, who was constantly travelling there in his imagination. Exactly 282 years later, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin actually made that dream a reality. Their astonishing achievement on July 20, 1969 led some to worry that the moon would become an object of purely scientific study – a barren and lifeless body, no longer a source of romantic inspiration. Fortunately, this fear did not come to pass. For example, in the year that marked the 40th anniversary of the landings ten years ago, the then poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy edited To the Moon: An Anthology of Lunar Poems which gathered together works from ancient to modern, and included her own poem, The Woman in the Moon. And while no woman has yet stepped on to this celestial body, women have long been associated with the moon – with its tidal pull, and the binary thinking that places it secondary in majesty to the sun. It is no wonder, then, that the moon has stimulated some incredible literature by female writers. The moon is often envisaged as a female entity, which inspired poems on the theme of her gaze as she looks down on Earth benignly. Way back in antiquity, the Greek poet Sappho did just this in her short song describing how: When, round and full, her silver face, Swims into sight, and lights all space. This trope continued for millennia and into the 19th century. Louisa May Alcott (author of Little Women) wrote The Mother Moon in 1856, imagining a benevolent maternal moon looking down on the Earth, occasionally hidden but ultimately undiminished by clouds. Also in the 19th century, American poet Emily Dickinson’s moon similarly shone “Her perfect Face Upon the World below”. Duffy’s more recent poem contains these familiar elements, being written in the persona of a woman in the moon – one who is incredulous anyone could have believed instead in a man in the moon. The woman in the moon has spent millennia observing Earth and now implores those gazing up at her to reflect on the neglect humans have wrought on planet Earth, repeating the question “What have you done?” Shining a light Of course, not all female literary responses to the moon have been quite so lyrical. Aphra Behn’s hilarious farce The Emperor of the Moon, which took the London stage by storm, is one example. Behn was one of the first English women to earn a sustained living through writing, breaking social barriers and becoming a valued literary role model for later generations of women authors. Based on a French source, but changed in many ways to make it Behn’s own, the play centres on a doctor, Baliardo, who is tricked into believing he is in the company of men from the moon. He longs to know whether the moon has seas, why it shines so brightly, and whether there is proof to the theory that its atmosphere was so like the Earth’s that it, too, was inhabited. The obsession makes him so gullible that when his daughter’s mischievous lover pretends to be the “Emperor Iredonzor”, and spouts clever sounding jargon in order to complete the disguise that he is an inhabitant of the moon descended to Earth, the doctor is convinced. The fake emperor of the moon is then able to convince his future father-in-law that he is conferring a great honour on the family through a conjugal union with his daughter (who is in on the scheme). As the play finishes, the doctor realises that he has conceded to marry his daughter not to a superior creature from another planet, but to the fairly ordinary boy next door. The farcical plot was spectacular and breathtaking in production and special effects. The original stage directions describe how: The Globe of the Moon appears, first, like a new Moon; as it moves forward it increases, till it comes to the Full. When it is descended, it opens, and shows the Emperor and the Prince. They come forth with all their Train, the Flutes playing a Symphony before him, which prepares the Song. We can only imagine the audience’s reaction, but the play was an enormous success, staged 130 times by 1749. If Behn had thoughts of space travel, too, she did not commit them to paper. But perhaps as NASA ramps up preparations for further lunar exploration, the moon will move out of the purely imaginary. Maybe women will at last be among the exclusive number of humans to have stepped on to the moon and gazed back to Earth for themselves.

    "body": "2020/09/14 - Researchers have a theory on why Jupiter’s moons are hotter than they should be Scientists believe one of the most likely places to find life inside our solar system could be on Jupiter’s moons. Recently scientists announced that Jupiter’s moons are hotter than they should be, considering that they are 483 million miles away from the sun. Previously, scientists believed that extra warmth in the moons was provided by Jupiter, but researchers now have a new hypothesis. Scientists now believe that Jupiter’s moons are heating each other via tidal heating. The new model looks at moon-to-moon heating and has found that the gravitational interplay between the moons could cause more tidal heating than results from orbiting Jupiter. Scientist Hamish Hay from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at NASA says that it’s surprising the moons cause so much heating despite being significantly smaller than Jupiter. Hay says that you wouldn’t expect the moons to create such a large tidal response. Researchers hope that the discovery will help astronomers learn more about the Jovian moon system’s evolution overall. Researchers know that there are at least 79 known Jovian moons so far. At least four of those moons are warm enough to hide oceans of liquid water under their surfaces. Io has more than 400 active volcanoes. Tidal heating works through a process known as tidal resonance were the moons essentially vibrate at certain frequencies, which is a phenomenon that happens everywhere with water, including on Earth. Resonance creates significantly more heating, according to Hay. The scientists notes that when something is pushed at the right frequency, the oscillations get larger and larger, just as when you push a swing. While calculating these natural frequencies for the moons, the researchers discovered that Jupiter’s tidal resonance alone doesn’t match the size of the oceans thought to be under the surface of some of the moons. Scientists are continuing the research with the ultimate goal of understanding the source for all the heat and its influence on the evolution and habitability of worlds across the solar system. "

The spacecraft send information and pictures back to Earth using the Deep Space Network (DSN). The DSN is a collection of big radio antennas in different parts of the world. There are DSN locations near Canberra in Australia, Madrid in Spain, and Goldstone in California. These sites are almost evenly spaced around the planet. That means as the Earth turns, we never lose sight of a spacecraft. Spacecraft send images and other information to these big antennas. The antennas also receive details about where the spacecraft are and how they are doing. At the same time, NASA uses the DSN to send lists of instructions out to the spacecraft. Our robotic explorers have a lot to do. The tools they use to communicate can’t be too heavy, take up too much room, or use too much power. Small antennas on the spacecraft can beam weak radio signals back to Earth. The farther away a spacecraft is, the larger the antenna you need to detect its signal. The largest antenna at each DSN site is 230 feet in diameter. The most distant objects that the DSN communicates with are NASA’s two Voyager spacecraft. Launched in 1977, Voyagers 1 and 2 studied Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Today, Voyager 1 is exploring beyond our solar system in interstellar space! Because the Voyagers are so far away, their signals to the antennas are very weak. In fact, the power that the DSN antennas receive from the Voyager signals is 20 billion times weaker than what is needed to run a digital watch! Engineers have figured out ways to boost those signals so they can be heard loud and clear. Centers at each DSN site receive incoming information. Then, they send it to the Space Flight Operations Facility at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. There, the photos and other data are processed and shared with scientists — and the rest of us! "

    "title": "Researchers study what makes memories so detailed and enduring",
    "body": "2020/09/14 - Washington D. C: The memories of the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to be etched in human minds with precision and clarity, distinct from other memories of 2020. The process which makes this possible has eluded scientists for many decades, but research led by the University of Bristol has made a breakthrough in understanding how memories can be so distinct and long-lasting without getting muddled up. The study, published in Nature Communications, describes a newly discovered mechanism of learning in the brain shown to stabilise memories and reduce interference between them. Its findings also provide new insight into how humans form expectations and make accurate predictions about what could happen in future. Memories are created when the connections between the nerve cells which send and receive signals from the brain are made stronger. This process has long been associated with changes to connections that excite neighbouring nerve cells in the hippocampus, a region of the brain crucial for memory formation. These excitatory connections must be balanced with inhibitory connections, which dampen nerve cell activity, for healthy brain function. The role of changes to inhibitory connection strength had not previously been considered and the researchers found that inhibitory connections between nerve cells, known as neurons, can similarly be strengthened. Working together with computational neuroscientists at Imperial College London, the researchers showed how this allows the stabilisation of memory representations. Their findings uncover for the first time how two different types of inhibitory connections (from parvalbumin and somatostatin expressing neurons) can also vary and increase their strength, just like excitatory connections. Moreover, computational modelling demonstrated this inhibitory learning enables the hippocampus to stabilise changes to excitatory connection strength, which prevents interfering information from disrupting memories. First author Dr Matt Udakis, Research Associate at the School of Physiology, Pharmacology, and Neuroscience, said: “We were all really excited when we discovered these two types of inhibitory neurons could alter their connections and partake in learning. It provides an explanation for what we all know to be true; that memories do not disappear as soon as we encounter a new experience. These new findings will help us understand why that is. ” “The computer modelling gave us important new insight into how inhibitory learning enables memories to be stable over time and not be susceptible to interference. That’s really important as it has previously been unclear how to separate memories can remain precise and robust,” added Udakis. The research was funded by the UKRI’s Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, which has awarded the teams further funding to develop this research and test their predictions from these findings by measuring the stability of memory representations.

The online course High School Aerospace Scholars (HAS) is based on NASA activities, related to space exploration, Earth science, technology, mathematics and aeronautics. NASA made the announcement of the course while celebrating the 58th anniversary of former US President John F Kennedy’s speech of September 12, 1962, where he spoke about the famous Apollo mission, which went on to achieve the magnanimous feat of landing man on Moon on July 20, 1969. Read President Kennedy’s full speech here. Students who apply for the program would be tasked to complete design challenges including 3D drawings, science quizzes, discussion posts, technology writings and monthly webinars with NASA scientists and engineers. The students who topped the course would be invited to NASA for a six-day residential summer experience and the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. The highest achieving students will get an opportunity to participate in team projects and briefings directed by NASA engineers and scientists, hands-on design challenge and engineering activities planning an Artemis-themed mission, and tours of NASA facilities. Students will also get an opportunity to work with NASA experts on designing a mission to Mars. The duration of the course is said to be one year.

This announcement came after the latest advancement of its Artemis lunar efforts. In this request, NASA has asked its private space partners to fly 10 NASA science investigations and technology demonstrations to a non-polar region of the Moon in 2022. These 14 CLPS private space agencies are owned by NASA which are used for various missions. The reason behind using these companies is that NASA can launch its missions quickly without having to develop technology and systems itself. All NASA has to do is pay a private company that already has the technology and system the space agency requires for its mission. Ten new payloads are set for delivery to a non-polar region of the Moon by 2022.

    "body": "2020/09/14 -  Advertisement -Dark Matter is appropriately named, theorized to account for most of the Universe’s missing mass. It is invisible and cannot be directly detected by the instruments and techniques of our time. When physicists tried to survey the Universe, they found that some of the phenomena that we can observe with our instruments cannot be explained by the observable distribution of mass and energy. Therefore, to explain it, they invented a very wacky concept, the concept of Dark Matter and Dark Energy. There has been some success when it comes to explaining all the effects of such a concept. However, it remains largely unresolved. A Galaxy Cluster is predicted to have a certain amount of dense Dark Matter around it. In a new observation, researchers have found that apart from the usual bending effect that Dark Matter has on incoming light from distant galaxies, there seems to be a part of this mysterious substance that is bending light more than it is supposed to.  Advertisement -While we can detect the presence of Dark Matter by the gravitational pull it exerts on nearby stars, the bending of light can tell us if some of it lies in between some distant galaxy and our home. The researchers have found that the number of clumps of this material that are bending light in this manner is surprising. These observations were made for clumps in distant clusters of galaxies. These clumps also have galaxies embedded in them and are denser than expected. There are some deep implications that come from this finding. A potential reason for such an observation could be that the computer simulations utilized the wrong methods to predict the galaxy cluster behaviour. The other more grave implication is that our understanding of Dark Matter is wrong. The bending effect, also known as gravitational lensing, is a direct implication of Einstein’s theory of relativity. Gravitational lensing is one of the most bizarre effects of gravity. According to the computer simulations, the population of galaxies surrounded by dark matter, that are massive enough to cause such distortions should be on the lower side. Researchers were studying about eleven Galaxy clusters when they realized that their count of thirteen cases of severe lensing was more frequent than what the simulations had predicted.  Advertisement -The observations indicate that there are more high-density dark matter clumps in real galaxy clusters than in simulated ones. While the observations and simulation results seem irreconcilable, some researchers think that the problem lies with our computer simulations, not our understanding of Dark Matter. Upcoming new telescopes such as the Euclid telescope and the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope can help clear up the matter. Large samples of observation can be taken using these and could help us understand where the fault lies.

    "body": "2020/09/14 - An undated NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image shows the massive galaxy cluster MACSJ 1206. (Reuters) WASHINGTON: Dark matter , mysterious invisible stuff that makes up most of the mass of galaxies including our own Milky Way , is confounding scientists again, with new observations of distant galaxies conflicting with the current understanding of its nature. Research published this week revealed an unexpected discrepancy between observations of dark matter concentrations in three massive clusters of galaxies encompassing trillions of stars and theoretical computer simulations of how dark matter should be distributed. ”Either there is a missing ingredient in the simulations or we have made a fundamental incorrect assumption about the nature of dark matter,” Yale University astrophysicist Priyamvada Natarajan, a co-author of the study published in the journal Science, said on Friday. Dark matter is the invisible glue that holds stars together inside a galaxy. It also creates an invisible scaffold that enables galaxies to form clusters. But it has very peculiar properties. It does not emit, absorb or reflect light and does not interact with any known particles. The bulk of the matter in the universe, about 96%, is thought to be dark matter, with ordinary matter - the visible stuff that makes up stars, planets and people - a mere 4%. Dark matter’s presence is known only through its gravitational pull on visible matter in space. It differs from the similarly enigmatic and unseen dark energy, which is considered a property of space and is driving the universe’s accelerated expansion. Dark energy is repulsive. Dark matter attracts through gravity. The new study involved observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and the European Southern Observatory ‘s Very Large Telescope in Chile When the light from distant sources like faraway galaxies travels through matter such as another galaxy or a cluster of them, the light is deflected and bends - a phenomenon called “gravitational lensing,” said astrophysicist and study lead author Massimo Meneghetti of the Observatory of Astrophysics and Space Science in Bologna and National Institute for Astrophysics in Italy. The new observations showed that gravitational lensing effects produced by galaxies residing inside the huge galaxy clusters were far stronger than current dark matter theory envisioned, suggesting an unexpectedly large concentration of dark matter in these galaxies. ”This is quite surprising,” Meneghetti said.

    "title": "The enduring mystery of Earth s water",
    "body": "2020/09/14 - You have to go to extreme lengths to find places on Earth that don’t reveal that they’re part of a water-rich planet. Even the highest and driest deserts, like the Atacama Plateau in South America, still get a minimum of a couple of millimetres of annual precipitation on average (although there are places where we don’t yet know what the average is because it’s simply not rained for years). And if you whip out your handy mass spectrometer on a desert walkabout the chances are that you’ll be able to detect at least a few atmospheric water molecules. Go elsewhere, and it’s hard to imagine anything but a water-logged world. More than 70 per cent of Earth’s surface is covered in oceans and roughly 97 per cent of the surface water is in those oceans, leaving a scant 1 per cent as fresh water. Water is also seldom static, whether it’s flowing in ocean currents or being evaporated and precipitated. Averaged out over the planet there is about 100 centimetres of rainfall a year, but that’s across a total surface area of around 5. 1x1018 square centimetres. In other words, doing the back-of-the-envelope calculation, some 510 trillion metric tons of water gets evaporated and then re-precipitated every year on Earth. But the catch is that we don’t really know where all of this water came from in the first place. For a long while our picture of the formation of a rocky planet like the Earth has involved a violent, hot assembly some 4. 5 billion years ago out of comparatively dry material in the inner solar system. Water would have come along later, with proposals for possible delivery by comets from the chill, frozen outer solar system, or by rocky but still volatile-rich meteoritic infall. But these options have proven tricky to justify completely for a variety of reasons. Comets, for instance, often (but not always) have a deuterium concentration that doesn’t match what we see in Earth’s water—limiting their likely contribution. Similarly, water-rich rocky meteoritic material—so-called carbonaceous chondrites—have isotopic differences that could also limit how much they contributed to a young planet. At the same time, the representative type of material for building the entirety of a rocky Earth (and matching the planet’s overall isotopic composition in elements like oxygen and calcium) seems to closely resemble what’s called enstatite chondrite. Chunks of enstatite chondrite are still around in the solar system, and occasionally fall as meteorites. But they’ve been thought to be too dry to be involved in Earth’s water supply. Now, in a work reported by Piani, et al. in the journal Science, an analysis of the composition of 13 enstatite chondrite meteorite samples reveals a much higher than expected hydrogen content. Extrapolating from these numbers the researchers claim that if this is the type of protoplanetary material that built Earth, it could have resulted in a total, initial water content of at least three times the present mass of water in our oceans. The same material could have also provided a starter mix of atmospheric nitrogen to the young planet. This possibility is enormously appealing for its relative simplicity: Our wet world was simply made this way from the very beginning, with little need to invoke any more complex evolution except for a small drizzling from comets and other outer solar system material. Whether or not this idea holds up to further scientific scrutiny, it’s a beautiful reminder that even the simplest things in our lives, like a glass of water or a shower in the morning, are actually windows into the deepest origins of everything we know.

Known as 2020 QL2, the asteroid is over 30. 48 cm (393 feet) in diameter which is wider than two professional American football fields put together. As per the data given out by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) of NASA, the rock is expected to fly past our planet at a speed of 38,624. 256 kilometres per hour. The asteroid will come as close as 6. 7 million kilometres to the Earth. The near-Earth object (NEO) with its massive size and proximity, however, has no chance of hitting our homeworld, assured the space agency. NASA defines a NEO as a space object that has a perihelion distance less than 1. 3 astronomical units (au). Here, perihelion is the point where the Earth is closest to the sun. Although comets can also be near-Earth objects, NASA says that the majority of the NEOs are asteroids. On the other hand, Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) are those that have the Earth Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance (MOID) of 0. 05 au (or 7. 4 million kilometres) or less and measure more than 460 feet in diameter. This asteroid will pass by our planet about 15 days after another potentially hazardous asteroid called ‘2011 ES4’ had flown past our planet. The space rock had come as close as 1. 2 lakh kilometre from Earth and NASA had said that it was the closest approach of an asteroid of its size in the ten years to come. The asteroid was between 22 to 50 metres wide and had passed by us on 1 September. "

    "body": "2020/09/14 - India has recorded over 90,000 Covid cases every day for the past few days (Representational) On the basis of so far unseen and unreleased official data, it is now clear that India is underestimating, massively, Covid numbers in the country. While we have officially announced a rise of 95,000-100,000 Covid cases every day - by far the highest in the world, of course - the unreleased data suggests that it could in fact be much higher: at 200,000 to 250,000 new cases every day (Table 1). This not only confirms that we are world number one in daily new cases, it puts us in an altogether different league from the rest of the world. Earlier we reported that India’s numbers were likely to be an underestimation because of the increasing reliance on the less accurate Rapid Antigen Tests (Chart A). It has already been established that Rapid Antigen tests miss a large percentage of Covid positive people and declare them as Covid negative. According to the literature, PCR tests, when conducted properly (and this is important), detect a much higher number of Covid cases - in fact two to three times higher, than Rapid Antigen tests. This is clear from official data of Delhi and Maharashtra (Table 2) which are known to have the best practices, methodology and techniques of PCR testing. This differential between the two tests is similar to global standards. However, the new data indicates a disturbing development. Rapid Antigen tests are easy to administer and require a simple procedure without amplification. PCR tests, on the other hand, to be accurate require a much higher degree of skill and training. If PCR tests are not carried out with the requisite checks and balances, the level of false-negativity rises rapidly. The new data (Table 3) suggests that this is exactly what may be happening in India. Based again on this recently accessed official data from all the other states (Table 4) - it is disturbing that the positivity rates of both types of tests should be almost the same. Consequently, it is clear that if the positivity rate of the Rapid Antigen test in India is around 7%, the positivity rate of PCR tests should be twice to three times that rate - suggesting that the PCR positivity rate in India is likely to be around 15% -20% or thereabouts. This means that instead of the daily reported 100,000 new cases - the truth is that India probably has 200,000-250,000 new cases every day (see Table 5). With at least 200,000 daily new cases, we need, as a nation to recognise that the reality on the ground is much worse than we acknowledge. It is a reality that requires vastly different medical and social policies than if the numbers were much lower as earlier believed.

However, recent research suggested that there is hope for microbial life on eons aloft in Venusian vapors. The surface of Venus is usually subject to temperatures around 800 degrees Fahrenheit but there are few layers of its atmosphere which are quite nice. Chances of life on Venus clouds NASA has even proposed an idea of creating a kind of cloud city by sending an instrument that can hang at an altitude of around 30 miles. The conditions here are considered to be similar to those on Earth’s surface. It has also been suggested that after Earth, only Venus’ atmosphere is the most habitable place in the solar system. This is due to its pressure and temperature, which are in the range we are used to. Read: Acid Cloud Wall Discovered On Venus That Has Existed For More Than Three Decades However, there are a few problems as well. The surface, unlike Earth’s, has no breathable air and lots of sulfuric acid in the atmosphere, hampering the functioning of respiratory systems and other vitals.

Seager and her colleagues suggest that the microbes above Venus can only survive inside liquid droplets. However, these droplets do not stay still as they grow large enough for the gravity to take over. The paper’s summary reads, “We propose for the first time that the only way life can survive indefinitely is with a life cycle that involves microbial life drying out as liquid droplets evaporate during settling, with the small desiccated ‘spores’ halting at, and partially populating, the Venus atmosphere stagnant lower haze layer”.

    "body": "2020/09/14 - Washington: NASA is looking for private companies from around the world that can grab lunar dirt and rocks, setting off the process of creating a new marketplace for space resources. Outlining its goal, the US space agency has said that it aims to complete the retrieval and transfer of ownership of the resources before 2024. NASA has set the goal of landing the first American woman and next man on the Moon by 2024. And it is not just one company that the US space agency is looking to purchase lunar resources from. “The solicitation creates a full and open competition, not limited to US companies, and the agency may make one or more awards,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine wrote in a blog post on Thursday. As per the requirements outlined by NASA, a company will collect a small amount of Moon “dirt” or rocks from any location on the lunar surface, provide imagery to the agency of the collection and the collected material, along with data that identifies the collection location. They will then have to conduct an “in-place” transfer of ownership of the lunar regolith or rocks to NASA. After ownership transfer, the collected material will become the sole property of NASA for its use. “NASA’s payment is exclusively for the lunar regolith, with any awardee receiving 10 percent at award, 10 per cent upon launch, and the remaining 80 per cent upon successful completion,” Bridenstine said, adding that the agency will determine retrieval methods for the transferred lunar regolith at a later date. According to a report in The Verge, NASA is ready to pay between $15,000 and $25,000 for the resources. The amount appears to be quite meagre considering the cost required to send a spacecraft to the Moon, but the idea here is to start the process of creating a lunar marketplace, said the report. Industry group Commercial Spaceflight Federation has welcomed NASA’s decision. “We applaud @NASA’s announcement to buy extracted lunar resources from commercial as another step towards a sustainable return to the Moon,” the federation said in a tweet on Thursday. The NASA Administrator said that when considering such proposals to buy lunar resources from private companies, the agency will require that “all actions be taken in a transparent fashion, in full compliance with the Registration Convention, Article II and other provisions of the Outer Space Treaty, and all of our other international obligations. ” “We are putting our policies into practice to fuel a new era of exploration and discovery that will benefit all of humanity,” Bridenstine said.

New Delhi   Jagran Trending Desk: In what could baffle the scientists and space researchers across the world, a new study has claimed that ‘carbon-rich’ exoplanets can be made of diamonds and silica.    A research which was published in The Planetary Science Journal has found that certain ‘carbon-rich’ exoplanets can be made up of diamonds and silica, “given the right circumstances”. The research, which was conducted by a team of scientists from the Arizona State University (ASU) and the University of Chicago, found that exoplanets that orbit stars with a “higher carbon to oxygen ration are more likely to convert diamond and silicate in the presence of water”. About the hypothesis: In their study, the researchers hypothesised that “these carbon-rich exoplanets could convert to diamond and silicate, if water (which is abundant in the universe) were present, creating a diamond-rich composition”. “To test this hypothesis, the research team needed to mimic the interior of carbide exoplanets using high heat and high pressure. To do so, they used high-pressure diamond-anvil cells at co-author Shim’s Lab for Earth and Planetary Materials,” the researchers said in an official statement, as reported by the Hindu BusinessLine. However, some researchers argue that the study’s findings are “too hard to be geologically active and this lack of geologic activity may make atmospheric composition uninhabitable”. “Regardless of habitability, this is one additional step in helping us understand and characterize our ever-increasing and improving observations of exoplanets,” said Allen-Sutter, the lead author of the study, as reported by the Hindu BusinessLine. “The more we learn, the better we’ll be able to interpret new data from upcoming future missions like the James Webb Space Telescope and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope to understand the worlds beyond on our own Solar System,” Sutter further said while adding that these exoplanets are unlike anything in our Solar System.

The image software on iPhones failed to capture the dystopian hue, or the feeling of being surrounded by it. Silicon Valley workers tweeted that it felt like night time, or a perpetual sunset, or a scene from “Blade Runner 2049. ” It marked the fourth week of severe fire and ash in the Western US. The conversation shifted from the already-apocalyptic pandemic to another global public health disaster: climate change. For those who don’t know, this is not what California is usually like. The first time I smelled smoke in my San Francisco apartment, in 2015, I imagined something nearby was on fire—not that it was happening miles north of the city. I turned on an air purifier, which I’d purchased for my partner’s allergies, never expecting it would be necessary for anything else. The climate disaster is undeniable to those who have experienced its harms, and a political talking point for the rest. Facebook is full of misinformation on the topic, which, when noticed and reported by users, is sent to the company’s third-party fact-checkers. Over the summer, a nonprofit called C02 Coalition, which claimed that carbon dioxide created by humans was beneficial for the planet, was banned from advertising on Facebook after too many fact violations. The group successfully appealed its ban, and had the fact-checks labels on its posts removed. Facebook said that it considered such posts to be opinions, ineligible for fact-checking, causing a miniature scandal when the checker, Climate Feedback, spoke out. ‘We don’t believe that articles in an opinion section should be immune from fact-checking,” Climate Feedback science editor Scott Johnson wrote in an email to Bloomberg. Facebook also doesn’t take the additional step of removing misinformation on the climate, because the company has ruled that such posts don’t cause imminent harm to human health. But, in the aggregate, they do. Facebook has recently re-evaluated its approach to climate misinformation, according to spokesman Andy Stone. The company is working on a climate information center, which will display information from scientific sources. Stone said Facebook isn’t ready to officially announce anything, but it’s easy to imagine what this might look like. Facebook has already devised centers for factual information about Covid-19, and about voting and the upcoming election, both of which it has promoted heavily on its site. The info center approach would put less pressure on evaluating each individual post, in favor of directing users to what they need to know more about generally. It could plausibly be more effective than the fact-checking process, which sometimes takes days or weeks to complete, long after a claim has gone viral. Of course, it won’t help address individual disputed claims. In the meantime, to get the general idea of what’s going on, anyone in Silicon Valley can look out the window.

    "body": "2020/09/11 - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may negatively affect bone health, according to a new study published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research. Results from the study indicate that women with a history of OSA may face a higher risk of spine, or vertebral, fractures. Using information from the Nurses’ Health Study, investigators examined data pertaining to 55,264 women without a prior history of bone fractures. OSA was self-reported in 1. 3 percent of participants in 2002 and increased to 3. 3 percent by 2012. Between 2002 and 2014, 461 vertebral fractures and 921 hip fractures occurred. Women with a history of OSA had a 2-fold higher risk of vertebral fracture relative to those with no OSA history, with the strongest association observed for OSA associated with daytime sleepiness. No association was observed between OSA history and risk of hip fracture. “Our study provides important evidence at the population level that obstructive sleep apnea may hurt bone health that is particularly relevant to the development of vertebral fracture,” said lead author Tianyi Huang, ScD, of Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “Given that we used self-reported clinical diagnoses of sleep apnea and fracture in our study, future studies could use more deeply characterized data to further the understanding of the mechanisms linking sleep apnea to bone health and fracture risk,” Huang added.

The phase I clinical trials are expected to start in November and will be tried out on 100 volunteers. It is the only vaccine of its type approved by China’s National Medical Products Administration, the state-run Global Times reported. The vaccine is a collaborative mission between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland. Microbiologist from the University of Hong Kong, Yuen Kwok-yung, said the vaccine stimulates the natural infection pathway of respiratory viruses to activate the immune response. Scientists do not expect side effects, except for minor nasal obstruction. It is not yet clear whether immunity generated from nasal spray vaccinations will last longer than from injected vaccines. The nasal spray vaccine uses live attenuated influenza vaccine; the other four technical routes China is using to develop the coronavirus vaccines are inactivated vaccines, adenoviral vector-based vaccines, and DNA and mRNA vaccines.

    "body": "2020/09/11 - BENGALURU: Doctors in the city do not share the recent conclusion of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) that convalescent plasma therapy has not helped in reducing Covid-19 deaths. They say they have been using the therapy in clinical trials for moderate to severe patients and it has helped save many lives. An ICMR study has cast doubts on the benefits of the therapy, setting off a debate among experts. A team of researchers from HCG cancer hospital in Bengaluru had received the Drug Controller General of India’s nod to study the potential use of plasma therapy in moderate Covid-19 cases through clinical trials. The team collaborated with the Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute. HCG has since tied up with 55 hospitals in Karnataka and administered convalescent plasma to 430 patients. “We have seen improvement in nearly 60 per cent of the patients. We are writing to the ICMR in this regard,” said Dr US Vishal Rao, principal investigator of the research. “All our plasma transfusions were strictly monitored for antibodies and then administered. In the ICMR study, researchers have not checked the plasma for antibodies. ”Since July, when the drug controller general allowed off-label use of convalescent plasma, multiple private hospitals have been using the therapy on their own. According to Dr C Shivaram, head of transfusion medicine at Manipal Hospitals, the ICMR study has not been able to demonstrate the benefits of plasma therapy unlike Mayo Clinic in the US, which showed a 37 per cent reduction in mortality. “One possible reason is poor patient selection. While the study was intended for moderate patients, undue pressure could have led to its use among severe patients,” said Dr Shivaram, adding that quantitation of antibodies through titres was not available when the ICMR study began. “Lack of standardisation of plasma is another point. When the ICMR trial began, there were no methods or kits to quantitate the antibody to SARS-CoV2 [virus that causes Covid-19] and hence, titration was made optional. This led to poor quality of plasma, with low titre of antibodies, being given to patients. ”Another doctor said it was too early to say plasma was not useful: “What would have been the condition of patients had they not received plasma?”According to Dr Rao, the ICMR’s findings don’t match with other studies because neutralising antibody titres were not used. “A study conducted by the ICGEB-Emory Vaccine Centre said 50 per cent of the patients didn’t have neutralising antibodies. The study included many Delhi patients. If plasma without required antibodies is used, it may not be effective. It’s like giving paracetamol of 0. 5mg to a patient with high fever,” Dr Rao said. "

    "title": "Coronavirus Who will get the vaccine first ",
    "body": "2020/09/11 - Image copyright Getty Images If or when scientists succeed in making a coronavirus vaccine, there won’t be enough to go around. Research labs and pharmaceutical companies are rewriting the rulebook on the time it takes to develop, test and manufacture an effective vaccine. Unprecedented steps are being taken to ensure roll-out of the vaccine is global. But there are concerns that the race to get one will be won by the richest countries, at the expense of the most vulnerable. So who will get it first, how much will it cost and, in a global crisis, how do we make sure nobody gets left behind? Vaccines to fight infectious diseases usually take years to develop, test and deliver. Even then, their success is not guaranteed. To date, only one human infectious disease has been totally eradicated - smallpox - and that took 200 years. The rest - from polio to tetanus, measles, mumps and TB - we live with, or without, thanks to vaccinations. How soon can we expect a coronavirus vaccine? Image copyright Reuters Trials involving thousands of people are already under way to see which vaccine can protect against Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by coronavirus. A process that usually takes five to 10 years, from research to delivery, is being pared down to months. In the meantime, manufacturing is being scaled up - with investors and manufacturers risking billions of dollars to be ready to produce an effective vaccine. Russia says trials of its Sputnik-V vaccine have shown signs of an immune response in patients and mass vaccination will start in October. China says it has developed a successful vaccine that is being made available to its military personnel. But concerns have been raised about the speed at which both vaccines have been produced. Neither are on the World Health Organization’s list of vaccines that have reached phase three clinical trials - the stage that involves more widespread testing in humans. Some of these leading candidates hope to get their vaccine approved by the end of the year - although the WHO has said it does not expect to see widespread vaccinations against Covid-19 until the middle of 2021. British drug manufacturer AstraZeneca, which has the licence for the Oxford University vaccine, is ramping up its global manufacturing capacity and has agreed to supply 100 million doses to the UK alone and possibly two billion globally - should it prove successful. Pfizer and BioNTech, who say they have invested more than $1bn in their Covid-19 programme developing an mRNA vaccine, expect to be ready to seek some form of regulatory approval as early as October this year. If approved, that would mean manufacturing up to 100 million doses by the end of 2020 and potentially more than 1. 3 billion doses by the end of 2021. There are around 20 other pharmaceutical companies with clinical trials under way. Not all of them will succeed - normally only about 10% of vaccine trials are successful. The hope is that the global focus, new alliances, and common purpose will raise the odds this time. But even if one of these vaccines is successful, the immediate shortfall is clear. Preventing vaccine nationalism Governments are hedging their bets to secure potential vaccines, making deals for millions of doses with a range of candidates before anything has been officially certified or approved. The UK government, for example, has signed deals for undisclosed sums for six potential coronavirus vaccines that may or may not prove successful. The US hopes to get 300 million doses by January from its investment programme to fast-track a successful vaccine. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has even advised states to be prepared for a vaccine roll-out as early as 1 November. But not all countries are in a position to do likewise. Organisations such the Medecins Sans Frontieres, often on the frontline delivering vaccines, say locking in advanced deals with pharmaceutical companies creates “a dangerous trend of vaccine nationalism by richer nations”. This in turn reduces global stocks available to the vulnerable in poorer countries. In the past, the price of life-saving vaccines has left countries struggling to fully immunise children against diseases such as meningitis, for example. Dr Mariângela Simão, the WHO’s assistant director-general responsible for access to medicines and health products, says we need to ensure vaccine nationalism is held in check. “The challenge will be to ensure equitable access - that all countries have access, not just those who can pay more. ” Is there a global vaccine task force? The WHO is working with the epidemic response group, Cepi, and the Vaccine Alliance of governments and organisations, known as Gavi, to try to level the playing field. At least 80 rich nations and economies, so far, have signed up to the global vaccine plan known as Covax, which aims to raise $2bn (£1. 52bn) by the end of 2020 to help buy and fairly distribute a drug worldwide. The US, which wants to leave the WHO, is not one of them. By pooling resources in Covax, participants hope to guarantee 92 lower income countries, in Africa, Asia and Latin America, also get “rapid, fair and equitable access” to Covid-19 vaccines. The facility is helping to fund a range of vaccine research and development work, and supporting manufacturers in scaling up production, where needed. Having a wide portfolio of vaccine trials signed up to their programme, they are hoping at least one will be successful so they can deliver two billion doses of safe, effective vaccines by the end of 2021. “With COVID-19 vaccines we want things to be different,” says Gavi’s CEO Dr Seth Berkley. “If only the wealthiest countries in the world are protected, then international trade, commerce and society as a whole will continue to be hit hard as the pandemic continues to rage across the globe. ” How much will it cost? While billions of dollars are being invested in vaccine development, millions more are being pledged to buy and supply the vaccine. Prices per dose depend on the type of vaccine, the manufacturer and the number of doses ordered. Pharmaceutical company Moderna, for example, is reportedly selling access to its potential vaccine at between $32 and $37 a dose (£24 to £28). AstraZeneca, on the other hand has said it will supply its vaccine “at cost” - or a few dollars per dose - during the pandemic. The Serum Institute of India (SSI), the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, is being backed by $150m from Gavi and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to make and deliver up to 100 million doses of the successful Covid-19 vaccines for India and low- and middle-income countries. They say the ceiling price will be $3 (£2. 28) a dose. But patients receiving the vaccine are unlikely to be charged in most cases. In the UK, mass distribution will be via the NHS health service. Student doctors and nurses, dentists and vets could be trained to back up existing NHS staff in administering the jab en masse. Consultation is currently under way. Other countries, such as Australia, have said they will offer free doses to their population. People receiving vaccines via humanitarian organisations - a vital cog in the global distribution wheel - will not be charged. In the US, while the shot might be free, healthcare professionals could charge for administering the jab - leaving uninsured Americans possibly facing a vaccine bill. So who gets it first? Although the pharmaceutical companies will be making the vaccine, they won’t be the ones who decide who gets vaccinated first. Image copyright EPA “Each organisation or country will have to determine who it immunises first and how it does that,” Sir Mene Pangalos - AstraZeneca’s Executive Vice President told the BBC. As the initial supply will be limited, reducing deaths and protecting health care systems are likely to be prioritised. The Gavi plan is that countries signed up to Covax, high or low income alike, will receive enough doses for 3% of their population - which would be enough to cover health and social care workers. As more vaccine is produced, allocation is increased to cover 20% of the population - this time prioritising over 65s and other vulnerable groups. After everybody has received 20%, the vaccine would be distributed according to other criteria, such as country vulnerability and immediate threat of Covid-19. Countries have until 18 September to commit to the programme and make their upfront payments by 9 October. Negotiations are still under way for many other elements of the allocation process. “The only certainty is that there won’t be enough - the rest is still up in the air,” says Dr Simao. Gavi insists richer participants can request enough doses to vaccinate between 10-50% of their population, but no country will receive enough doses to vaccinate more than 20% until all countries in the group have been offered this amount. Dr Berkley says a small buffer of about 5% of the total number of available doses will be kept aside, “to build a stockpile to help with acute outbreaks and to support humanitarian organisations, for example to vaccinate refugees who may not otherwise have access”. How do you distribute a global vaccine? Image copyright Markel Redondo/ MSF A lot depends on which vaccine is successful. The ideal vaccine has a lot to live up to. It needs to be affordable. It needs to generate strong, long-lasting immunity. It needs a simple refrigerated distribution system and manufacturers must be able to scale-up production rapidly. The WHO, UNICEF and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MFS / Doctors Without Borders), already have effective vaccination programmes in place around the world with the so called “cold chain” facilities - cooler trucks and solar fridges to keep vaccines at the right temperature as they travel from factory to field. But adding a new vaccine to the mix could pose huge logistical problems for those already facing a difficult environment. Vaccines usually need to be kept refrigerated - usually between 2C and 8C. That’s not too much of a challenge in most developed countries, but can be an “immense task” where infrastructure is weak and electricity supply and refrigeration unstable. “Maintaining vaccines under cold chain is already one of the biggest challenges’ countries face and this will be exacerbated with the introduction of a new vaccine,” MSF medical adviser Barbara Saitta told the BBC. “You will need to add more cold chain equipment, make sure you always have fuel (to run freezer and refrigerators in absence of electricity) and repair/replace them when they break and transport them wherever you need them. ” AstraZeneca has suggested their vaccine would need the regular cold chain between 2C and 8C. But it looks like some candidate vaccines will need ultra-cold chain - storage at -60C or colder before being diluted and distributed. “To keep the Ebola vaccine at -60°C or colder we had to use a special cold chain equipment to store and transport them, plus we had to train staff to use all this new equipment,” said Barbara Saitta. There is also the question of the target population. Vaccination programmes usually target children, so agencies will have to plan how to reach people that normally are not part of the immunization program. As the world waits for the scientists to do their bit, many more challenges await. And vaccines are not the only weapon against coronavirus. “Vaccines are not the only solution,” Says Dr Simao, of the WHO. “You need to have diagnostics. You need to have a way to decrease mortality, so you need therapeutics, and you need a vaccine. “Besides that, you need everything else - social distancing, avoiding crowded places and so on. ” What do I need to know about the coronavirus?

    "title": "Bose launches QuietComfort Earbuds Sport Earbuds and three new Frames",
    "body": "2020/09/11 - Bose has launched a slew of products, including two wireless earbuds and three new audio sunglasses. The first and most important of these are the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. These $280 pair are the company’s first in-ear truly wireless noise-canceling earphones. As the name suggests, the QuietComfort Earbuds feature Bose’ active noise-canceling system that uses microphones and a new algorithm to cancel out ambient noise. The semi in-ear design ear tips also help block sound passively and feature fins to keep them in place. Like the Bose Headphones 700, the QuietComfort Earbuds also feature customizable noise cancellation, where you can dial in the degree of cancellation if you want to let in some of the ambient sound. You can also enable full transparency to let in all of the ambient sound. Bose makes pretty bold claims regarding the sound, claiming you won’t find better sounding wireless earbuds. The company has tuned the QuietComfort Earbuds for a more natural sound and there’s also a new volume-optimized Active EQ feature that adjusts sound based on volume to make up for low frequency loss at lower volumes and prevents distortion at higher volumes. The QC Earbuds support Bluetooth 5. 1 and the AAC codec. The QC Earbuds feature a touch sensitive outside surface and all controls are accessed using touch gestures. The Earbuds are also IPX4 rated for water and sweat resistance. The QC Earbuds come in two colors, Triple Black, and Soapstone. Lastly, Bose claims 6 hours of battery life with continuous use and the charging case provides two additional charges for a total of 18 hours. The Earbuds can provide up to 2 hours of playback with a 2-hour charge and the charging case is Qi-certified for wireless charging. Next is the Bose Sport Earbuds. These $180 wireless earbuds lack active noise-cancellation but are fairly similar otherwise. With the focus on workouts, the Sport Earbuds also feature IPX4 water-resistance and Bose’ StayHear Max tips with the semi in-ear design and a tiny wing to keep them in place. Unlike the QC Earbuds, the Sport Earbuds support Bluetooth 5. 0 but still have the same AAC support and Active EQ. They also have 5 hours of battery life and the case provides two more full charges for a total of 15 hours. Like the QC Earbuds, the Sport Earbuds also have a touch sensitive outside surface for controls. The Sport Earbuds come in three colors, Baltic Blue, Glacier White, and Triple Black. Bose also announced the second generation of its audio sunglasses. The new Bose Frames come in three versions, Soprano, Tenor, and Tempo. The Soprano and Tenor are similar, with the main difference being the design. The Soprano have a cat eye lens design while the Tenor have a square frame. Other than that, both feature a nylon frame, high-gloss black finish, and polycarbonate polarized lenses. Both also feature swap-out lenses that can be replaced with optional mirrored rose gold and purple fade lenses for the Soprano, and Mirrored Silver and Mirrored Blue for Tenor. Or you could use your prescription lenses. Both also have the same Bose Open Ear Audio design that is said to be fuller and deeper sounding than previous generation models. They have 5. 5 hours of battery life, and beamforming microphone array for voice calls. Both also feature touch sensitive sides for controlling volume and playback and have a motion sensor that detects when you remove them to turn them off. Finally, there’s the Bose Frames Tempo, which have a sporty design. They feature soft silicone nose pads that come in three sizes in the box. The included polycarbonate polarized lenses have a mirrored black finish with 12% VLT (visible light transmission) but can be swapped out for Road Orange that allows 20% VLT, Trail Blue that allows 28% VLT, and Twilight Yellow that allows 77% VLT. All of these are ideal for different environments and different time of day so you can pick based on your needs. Lastly, the Tempo is also IPX4 splash resistant. Apart from these differences, the Tempo is similar to the Soprano and Tenor. All three are priced at $250. "

    "title": "Company of Heroes finally arrives on Android with an excellent port",
    "body": "2020/09/11 - Feral Interactive has ported a solid library of console-quality games to Android over the years, and today the studio has finally released Company of Heroes on Android. Feral originally brought this popular real-time strategy game to the iPad back in February (2020), and over the last few months, has been working on the smartphone version for both Android and iOS. So if you’re looking for a deep strategy game to dive into on your smartphone, starting today, you can grab Company of Heroes from the Play Store for $13. 99. If you’re unfamiliar with Company of Heroes, the above trailer offers a quick look at what this strategy game will provide. Everything takes place in real-time, and as you can see, the game is themed around World War II. The gameplay is mostly comprised of micromanaging your squads (you control troops, not individuals) as you follow each level’s objectives. These objectives will range from simple things like moving your troops to certain locations to the more difficult tasks like winning close-quarter skirmishes. All in all, Company of Heroes plays like a traditional RTS, so things like resource management and base-building are also in the mix. As for performance, after testing the game on my Red Magic 5S and OnePlus 8, I can confirm Company of Heroes performs admirably. Load times are better than I expected, and the framerate is stable, even during demanding skirmishes. Really, the only thing I can see holding people back is the small UI. After all, Company of Heroes started as a PC game designed to be controlled with a mouse, and while the touch controls in today’s port work well enough, you’ll still have to deal with a few tiny buttons as well as limited screen space. And there’s no getting out of this. The entire game is built around touch controls, and it does not support controllers. This also means the game does not support the Nvidia Shield, though this isn’t surprising since this port was explicitly designed for smartphones. There also appears to be no way to play online, so it would seem this feature was removed for the mobile version. Like all of Feral’s mobile ports, Company of Heroes is a premium release. This means you’ll have to plunk down $13. 99 if you’d like to play. To put this price into perspective, Company of Heroes is still selling for $19. 99 on Steam. So the Android port is priced rather competitively, which is always lovely to see. Now, we’ve known that Company of Heroes would come to Android since April (2020), and while it feels like it’s been a long wait, it’s finally here, and I’m glad to report that the wait was worth it. Not only is this a solid port that performs well, but the game itself is also pretty dang fun, especially if you enjoy real-time strategy games. While the small UI, lack of online play, and $14 price tag may hold a few people back from taking the plunge, there’s no denying that console-quality strategy games are hard to come by on Android. So if you don’t mind a few caveats, you can grab Company of Heroes from the Play Store widget below. "

This includes a new Catalogue Shortcut for business accounts enabling quick access to their product portfolio. There is also a new ‘Add WhatsApp Doodles’ option that is under development allowing users to make their solid wallpaper look a bit more fancy. Separately, a new ‘Call’ button is also under works. This new call button looks to slightly tweak the process of making video and voice calls inside the app. WABetaInfo, which tracks new features in WhatsApp, dug into the latest WhatsApp 2. 20. 200. 3 beta for Android to spot several new features. The first one is the possible addition of a quick shortcut in business chats, when the business has set a catalogue. This catalogue icon will be added next to the Call button whenever it arrives. This new shortcut is under development and will not be seen even if users are on the latest beta. Separately, WhatsApp is also working on a new Call button that will combine the video and voice call shortcuts into one. Currently, we see separate icons in chats for video and voice calls, but this new button looks to combine the two, and when you tap on the button, it will allow choosing the call type. This new shortcut could tweak the process of calls a little bit. It is under development and is reported to be available in a future build. The tracker says that this new call button will initially be available in business chats only WhatsApp may later expand the feature for other chats too. WhatsApp is also working on several wallpaper improvements, as reported in the past, and one of the new improvements is the ability to add doodles on a solid chat wallpaper in chats A new ‘Add WhatsApp Doddles’ option has been spotted in WhatsApp 2. 20. 200. 3 beta for Android enabling users to superimpose doodles in chat wallpapers. Again, this feature is also not enabled for beta users yet and was only found in the code. In 2020, will WhatsApp get the killer feature that every Indian is waiting for?

In an interview with Axios on Tuesday, Zuckerberg said that people should be looking into the “unilateral control” that Apple has over “what gets on phones, in terms of apps. ” He, however, fell short of saying that it is a government agency that should investigate Apple in relation to its App Store rules.

    "body": "2020/09/11 - The iPhone 12 isn’t expected to emerge from the shadows until October. But that won’t necessarily stop it appearing at Apple’s Sept. 15 Event next week. A JP Morgan report, seen by AppleInsider, goes against the popular consensus among leakers and rumor followers that next week’s event will be all about the Apple Watch 6. As Samik Chatterjee writes in the report: “do not rule out the possibility of a combined launch announcement for Watch, iPad and iPhone on September 15. ” iPhone 12 release date, price, specs and leaks Find out what else Apple has in store with our Apple Watch 6 guide “Apple has talked about a delay of a few weeks for iPhones relative to its typical shipping schedule on the last earnings call,” Chatterjee continues. “However, press reports … indicate moderating delays and manufacturing starting in mid-September, which should position the company to ship some iPhone SKUs in mid-October,” Essentially, the report argues that if Apple is able to gain back time lost earlier in the year, then it’s possible that at least some of the models could make it to stores in October. We’ve heard similar rumors to this before, some claiming the iPhone 12 Pro Max will arrive later, others that it will be the Pro Max and the basic iPhone 12 that come late. The JP Morgan also repeats claims that only the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max will feature mmWave 5G. While all models are believed to be sub6GHz compatible, only the two most expensive iPhone 12 versions will work with the faster 5G standard. mmWave 5G is used in the U. S. by Verizon and other countries around the world, but not currently the U. K. As Chatterjee and other rumors have claimed, the Apple event next week will see the launch of the Apple Watch 6 and a new iPad, assumed to be the iPad Air 4 rather than a refreshed basic iPad or iPad Pro. Chatterjee also mentions the rumored Apple services bundle, which would combine Apple News, TV and Music under a single banner. The iPhone 12 range, which is made up of four separate handsets, will be the first device to use Apple’s A14 chipset. Another first will be that the whole range will use OLED displays, instead of a mix of OLED and LCD panels. The larger iPhone 12 Pro models are expected to add on a new LiDAR depth sensor for increased versatility when it comes to camera effects and AR apps. We could be getting our first glimpses at these phones as soon as next week, so stay tuned for more. "

    "body": "2020/09/11 - After a lot of wait and leaks, Apple has gone ahead and sent out invites for its September event that’s scheduled for the 15th of the month. However, unlike previous September events where we see the new iPhones, this September event is going to be slightly different. Apple The event invite has the Apple logo that looks doodled by hand, followed by the text Time Flies. This signifies that the event is going to be surrounding Apple Watch and the iPad. This basically means that we won’t be seeing an iPhone at this event. This isn’t surprising, since several reports in the past have indicated that the new iPhone 12’s are going to be delayed due to the novel coronavirus and is expected to hit the shelves sometime in October. Moreover, since this year we’re going to see so many different iterations of the iPhone 12’s, perhaps Apple has something special planned for that event. Now, coming to the devices Apple could launch at this event. We could expect a successor to the 2019 iPad Air with a considerably faster CPU and hopefully a display with thinner bezels than the previous version – this is something the leaks that spotted new iPad variants at the EEC have shed some light on too. We could also expect the new iPads to support the second-generation Apple Pencil with support for wireless charging. Reuters Coming to the Apple Watch, we can hope that the Series 6 could get a better, higher quality display, in a lighter, and sleeker body along with a newer processor that not only offers better performance but also consumes less battery. The event is expected to commence at 10:00 AM PDT which is around 10:30 PM IST. In case you’re interested in watching this you’ll need to head to Apple’s website here to watch the live stream.

    "title": "Triumph Motorcycles brings all new Rocket 3 GT to India price starts at Rs 18 40 lakh",
    "body": "2020/09/11 - NEW DELHI: British premium motorcycle brand Triumph Motorcycles on Thursday (September 10) launched its tourer model, the all-new Rocket 3 GT power cruiser in India priced at Rs 18. 40 lakh (ex-showroom). It is priced Rs 40,000 higher than the regular Rocket 3 motorcycle which has been priced at Rs 18 lakh. The latest version of the Rocket 3 motorcycle looks to create ‘excitement’ in the market which has been reeling under the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The Rocket 3 GT is the touring variant of the Rocket 3R which was launched in December 2019 and is powered by an all-new 2,500 cc engine, which the company claims is ‘the world’s biggest production motorcycle engine’. “We are focussing greatly on how to continue to create excitement in this industry. We all know we are stressed in the industry right now. The focus from our side is to continuously give reason for customers to come to our showroom and buy our products,” Triumph Motorcycles India Business Head Shoeb Farooq told PTI. He said the company is focussing on bringing new products with ‘aggressive pricing’ in each segment in order to overcome the current headwinds faced by the industry, specially in the premium motorcycle segment. “We have launched the Rocket 3 GT at a very very aggressive pricing of Rs 18. 40 lakh, which is Rs 40,000 more from the Rocket 3R that we already have. I am sure this is going to go very well with the current context of the situation in the industry,” Farooq said. Globally, the price difference between Rocket 3 GT and the Rocket 3R could range between Rs 1-2 lakh depending on variant, he added. Stating that the Rocket 3 GT completes the Rocket range which has the roadster and touring variants, Farooq said,”This is another addition to our already robust BS-VI line-up. We are having the biggest line-up of BS-VI in the premium space. This is the 13th BS-VI motorcycle model we have launched in India. ” The company had started launching its BS-VI compliant models from January onwards though the last four-five months were turbulent. Triumph Motorcycles said with a weight saving of more than 40kg, the all-new Rocket 3 GT is more than 13 per cent lighter than the previous generation. It is also equipped with safety features such as optimised cornering anti-lock braking system (ABS) as standard on Rocket 3 GT to maintain optimum braking performance and hill hold control that prevents the bike rolling backwards. The model is also equipped with features such as turn-by-turn navigation system, cruise control, and keyless ignition. "

    "title": "Android 11 is now available here s what s new",
    "body": "2020/09/11 - The big picture: Android 11 isn’t packed with new features, and that’s a good thing – Google just made the existing ones more prominent and easier to use. Android phone makers are finally making a true effort with timely updates for select devices, but that won’t solve the fragmentation problem anytime soon, and Android still needs optimizations to work better on tablets. Google has started rolling out Android 11 to the general public after several months of beta testing. The latest update to the operating system will become available first on Pixel devices ranging from the Pixel 2 to the new Pixel 4A, which is the new budget camera quality leader with a starting price of $350. The latest build of Android 11 is also landing as a beta on more devices such as Xiaomi’s Mi 10 and Mi 10 Pro smartphones, the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro, the Realme X50 Pro, and Oppo’s Reno 3, Find X2, and Find X2 Pro phones. Google says we can expect more manufacturers to make Android 11 available in the coming months. Features With Android 11, Google mainly sought to make the complex feature set already present on Android more prominent and easier to use. For instance, the small bubble avatars that float on the screen allow you to navigate in and out of chats more easily and there’s a dedicated section for messaging apps at the very top of the notification shade. For priority conversations, people of your choosing can now break through your Do Not Disturb settings. You also get quick access to all your smart home devices connected to Google Assistant with the same power menu that used to bring up credit and reward cards. That means you can long press the power button instead of opening several different apps to control your thermostat, lights, or smart locks. The notification shade has gained universal media controls in the notification toggle section, which solves one of Android’s biggest annoyances. The lock screen media player has few cosmetic changes, the most noticeable is the removal of the album art when music is playing. The sound control pop-up is more compact and you can now set where the sound output goes. Another annoyance on Android has been the 4 GB file limit for video recordings, now removed, so you can shoot videos until your phone catches fire runs out of storage space or battery power. If you happen to own one of over 500 compatible cars, Android Auto now works wirelessly with any smartphone running Android 11. If you have an older car, there’s always Sony’s massive 9-inch touch display, even if it’s a pricey bit of kit. A built-in screen recorder has been added for those of you who have been waiting for a native solution, and the Recents panel allows you to select text or take a screenshot using dedicated buttons. Security and System Updates Android 11 isn’t just about UI changes, though. Google is following in Apple’s footsteps by locking down permissions so that they’re much more difficult to abuse for data harvesting purposes. Now applications will ask you every time they need permission to access to your microphone, camera, or location – with the choice of whether to grant that permission once or every time the app is in use. Granting an app to continuous access now requires you to go into the phone settings to set that behavior, as Google wants you to be absolutely sure about that decision. Furthermore, if you stop using an app for a long time, the app’s permissions will be automatically reset and upon opening it you’ll be asked again to decide on the level of access you are willing to give it moving forward. If you’re using a company-provided Android phone, Google designed Android 11 with some added protections that ensure a separation between work and personal data, making the latter off-limits for IT admins. Accessibility is also improved with Voice Access understanding screen content and context better, as well as generating labels and access points for voice commands. Android 11 brings many other smaller changes, but these will be the most noticeable of them all. More importantly, Google is finally getting more Android manufacturers on board with the idea of timely updates. "

    "body": "2020/09/11 - Samsung M51 vs OnePlus Nord (Express Photo: Anuj Bhatia and OnePlus Nord) With Samsung Galaxy M51’s launch, the South-Korean tech giant has created a competitor to the mid-range smartphone OnePlus Nord which was launched in July earlier this year. Samsung M51 is a decent all-rounder in the mid-range segment and can benefit from the current situations as few customers are looking for a phone that is not made in China amidst the growing tension on the border. Let’s take a look at the two phones in detail. Samsung M51 vs OnePlus Nord: Display Samsung M51 comes with a 6. 7-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED Plus Infinity O Display that offers a 20:9 aspect ratio with Gorilla Glass 3 protection support. OnePlus Nord has a 6. 44-inch AMOLED panel with the same aspect ratio as Samsung. But OnePlus overpowers Samsung by offering a 90Hz refresh rate. Samsung Galaxy M51 (Express photo: Anuj Bhatia) Samsung Galaxy M51 (Express photo: Anuj Bhatia) Samsung M51 vs OnePlus Nord: Processor Samsung M51 runs on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G processor with up to 2. 2GHz octa-core processor which is capable of running FPS games smoothly. OnePlus Nord has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G processor which is superior when compared to the 730G. (Express Photo: Nandagopal Rajan) (Express Photo: Nandagopal Rajan) Samsung M51 vs OnePlus Nord: Camera Both the smartphones have a quad-camera setup on the rear. Samsung M51 has a 64MP primary Sony IMX 682 sensor, 12MP secondary ultra-wide lens with a 123-degree field of view, 5MP portrait lens and 5MP macro sensor. OnePlus Nord has a 48MP Sony IMX 586 primary sensor, 8MP ultra-wide lens with 119 field-of-view, 5MP macro lens, and a 2MP depth sensor.

It has the same 32MP camera as Samsung M51 paired with an 8MP sensor. Samsung Galaxy M51 (Express Photo by Anuj Bhatia) Samsung Galaxy M51 (Express Photo by Anuj Bhatia) Samsung M51 vs OnePlus Nord: Battery Samsung M51 has a massive 7,000 mAh battery, the largest ever on its smartphone. However, the massive battery does take nearly two hours to charge fully with 25W fast charging. On the other hand, OnePlus Nord has a 4,115 mAh battery with support for 30W Warp charging. It takes much lesser to charge the phone fully. Also, OnePlus claims that it can charge the phone from 0 to 70 per cent in just 30 minutes. But Samsung M51’s large battery will ensure that you stay away from the charging point for a long while. Samsung M51 vs OnePlus Nord: Price Samsung M51 retails at Rs 24,999 for the 6GB+128GB variant and Rs 26,999 for the 8GB+128GB variant. OnePlus Nord has three variants.

    "title": "Huawei will selectively incorporate some of Android 11 s features into EMUI",
    "body": "2020/09/11 - Huawei told Android Authority it plans to selectively integrate select Android 11 features into EMUI. The company didn’t have access to Android 11’s codebase until earlier this week when Google officially released the OS. The company also told us it feels EMUI has surpassed Android in a lot of ways. If you’ve been following the development of EMUI 11, you’ll know that Huawei built the latest version of its mobile operating system on top of Android 10, not Android 11 — which Google released to its Pixel devices on September 8. As a Huawei device owner, you might then ask yourself when Huawei will migrate EMUI to an Android 11 base. But it turns out the better question is when EMUI will adopt some of Android 11’s features. “The sure thing is that, after Android 11 is officially open-sourced, we will selectively incorporate some of its features into EMUI 11,” a spokesperson for Huawei told Android Authority. Huawei didn’t go on to say the specific Android 11 features it plans to incorporate into EMUI, but the statement confirms what we thought was the case. Due to the ongoing US trade sanctions on Huawei, the company didn’t have access to Android 11’s codebase until earlier this week when it became officially available and open source. In other words, work on those features just started. However, at least from the outside looking in, it doesn’t look like Huawei is any rush. Citing features like its proprietary GPU Turbo technology, the company told Android Authority, “In recent years, EMUI has been able to surpass Android in many aspects…” Some of what is at play here is a company trying to appear strong in the face of a challenging situation. However, Huawei’s response also speaks to just how much OEMs customize their software over stock Android. Whether its Samsung with One UI or OnePlus with Oxygen OS, plenty of OEMs prioritize developing their own features — which help them differentiate their phones — over keeping pace with Google’s software releases. It’s probably unfair to expect Huawei would pivot away from that priority, even with the situation it finds itself in currently. Next: Everything you need to know about Android 11 "

    "body": "2020/09/11 - Musk’s brain chip ambition presents ethical dilemma Nidhal Guessoum Short Url https://arab. news/jnfuk Elon Musk last week made another public presentation that was meant to drop our jaws: A pig (affectionately named Gertrude) with a chip in her brain showing a signal whenever she sniffed for food. The signal and the demonstration were far from impressive, but Musk added various explanations and comments to convince us that “the future is going to be weird,” as he put it. First, some reassurance had to be given that putting a coin-sized chip in a brain is safe. So, with Gertrude, another two pigs were displayed: One that had a chip implanted in its brain and then removed, and one that had never had any such thing. All three pigs seemed normal, with nothing to tell which had that kind of intervention. Musk joked: “I could have a chip just under my hair and you wouldn’t know it… maybe I do. ” Second, some basic explanation of how that “brain reading” works. The chip just detects electric signals and sends them wirelessly to a computer, where a program interprets the specific neural activity, in this case “sniffing for food. ” The same kind of chip has been tried on mice and monkeys. Most importantly, Neuralink (Musk’s company doing this research) applied for human trial permits last year and preliminary authorization has been given, so testing will start later this year. So is this a breakthrough? Will this have positive and important applications for us humans? Or is this some misguided research by the transhumanist gang? Until now, we have had two things. The first is the prosthetics (metallic or plastic arms and legs, mainly) that can connect to nerves in one’s body and be controlled by the brain, nicely replacing any cut-off limb. No chip needed in the brain, and wonderful applications, thank you. The second is the wired head caps that can detect brain waves and have them interpreted by a computer program. These “EEGs” are done in hospitals every day, but they are also used by “futuristic” gamers to play without using any control devices, but rather by sending commands wirelessly from their brain to the computer or video games machine. Three years ago, Facebook announced a project to develop a headband that would allow people to type 100 words per minute just by thinking. And, last year, it revealed that it was funding extensive university research to that effect, with human volunteers. Some transhumanists have implanted chips in their hands (to open doors as if with a magnetic card, for example) or, in very rare cases, in their heads, for other purposes. But, mostly, no serious work has been done with chips in human brains. Musk wants to change that. Why? For two reasons. One, he says, is that we are in a race with artificial intelligence and if machines reach superintelligence before us we may be doomed, as they (the machines) may just decide to get rid of us, as we will be useless and a nuisance (to them). Thus, Musk and the transhumanists say, we have a duty to reach higher and higher levels of intelligence — and one way to do that is to link our brains with powerful computers and smart programs. If used in limited, specific applications, Elon Musk’s Neuralink chip in the brain can be a positive development. But if allowed to be applied in dangerous fields, it may be just an evil Pandora’s box. Nidhal Guessoum Two, they stress, is that there can be important medical applications for chips in our brains: They could help remedy conditions like spinal cord injuries, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s and dementia, epilepsy, and other serious illnesses. How would that work? By programming the chip to stop the early signals associated with trembling and seizures, averting them before they develop. However, I must note that this is far from possible now; this is — at best — sometime in the future, if we allow such developments to occur. Indeed, decoding brain signals is notoriously complex and simply reading signals that one can then both quickly associate with trembling and seizures and stop is easier said than done. Now, what are the concerns? First, there is a fundamental difference between non-invasive brain-device connections (as with prosthetics) and invasive chip-in-the-brain systems: For example, the risk of internal damage or scars are non-negligible; the human body does not like “foreign objects” and will attack them (chemically); and secondary, unintended effects (such as impulses and strange actions) have been observed when wires are introduced in people’s brains even temporarily. Secondly, and very importantly, there are issues of privacy (of one’s thoughts) and security: Can someone’s brain be hacked and probed for ideas and memories? Musk seems to think that “uploading” one’s memories to a machine, storing them and downloading them back later is a great prospect to look forward to. He does not seem to see the potential abuse of that capability, if — and it’s a big if — and when that becomes possible. It is true this is not inherent in the procedure itself, but rather rests in how it may be used or abused. But still we need to keep that in mind. To make a long story short, this brain chip is not (yet) a breakthrough; it only will be when it is successfully tested on humans. However, we definitely need to discuss it and set guidelines for it. If used in limited, specific applications, it can be a positive development. But if allowed to be applied in dangerous fields (including the military), it may be just an evil Pandora’s box. As always, science, research and technology must proceed under the guidance of ethics, which is society’s wise men and women.

The star of the mission (and the incredible video) is a Falcon 9 first stage booster that SpaceX calls B1059. 5. It’s the latest booster in the private spaceflight company’s fleet of veteran rockets, to launch and land five times. In the video , the booster is seen leaping off of its launch pad at Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, conducting an aerial somersault and then landing gently at its designated landing pad. SpaceX released the video on YouTube on Wednesday (Sept. 9).

(Image credit: SpaceX) The main payload on the frequent flier was the SAOCOM-1B Earth-observing satellite built for Argentina’s space agency, the Comisión Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE). The sophisticated radar imager flew into orbit along with two smaller satellites. The mission marked the first time a satellite launched into a polar-orbiting trajectory from Florida since the 1960s. Typically, this type of mission launches from the West Coast because the rocket would have a clear path north or south, without having to avoid flying over populated areas. (That’s because debris from a Thor rocket reportedly killed a cow in Cuba in 1969, resulting in a launch venue change for polar missions. ) The launch also included an onboard camera that captured stunning footage of the rocket as it blasted off and then returned to Earth. The footage is sped up significantly, packing the whole process into just two minutes of incredible footage. In the video, you can hear the roar of Falcon 9’s nine Merlin engines as the rocket climbs to space, followed by bursts from its onboard thrusters. Viewers are even treated to a stunning display of pyrotechnics as the rocket fires up one of its engines during a series of planned burns to slow its descent enough to land. To date, SpaceX has recovered 18 Falcon 9 first stage boosters on land at Cape Canaveral, and additional 42 boosters on floating platforms at sea. With 16 missions under its belt so far this year, SpaceX is gearing up for yet another Starlink mission . The 13th Starlink mission is estimated to launch sometime next week, and will deliver a new batch of the company’s own internet-beaming satellites into orbit.

    "body": "2020/09/11 - The thriller of how big cyclones keep collectively in geometric patterns across the poles of Jupiter could now be solved, however new questions have emerged as to how these clusters shaped within the first place, a brand new examine finds. After NASA’s Juno probe entered orbit round Jupiter in 2016, the spacecraft found big cyclones organized in geometric patterns around the globe’s poles. On the planet’s north pole, there are eight vortices surrounding a central vortex, and on the south pole there are six. “We had been shocked that Jupiter’s poles should not like these of different planets,” examine lead writer Cheng Li, a planetary scientist on the College of California, Berkeley, advised House. com. “We by no means noticed something earlier than like these clusters of cyclones organized into common patterns. ” Associated: Soar over Jupiter’s monster polar storms with this gorgeous NASA video Every gargantuan tempest ranges between 2,485 to 4,350 miles (4,000 to 7,000 kilometers) vast, they usually encircle their respective poles at distances of 5,400 miles (8,700 km). These cyclones and these patterns have endured for at the least 4 years since Juno arrived at Jupiter. It was a thriller to scientists as to how these clusters saved secure. On Earth, cyclones drift poleward however dissipate over land and chilly water, Li mentioned. In distinction, Jupiter has neither land nor oceans, elevating the query of why the cyclones didn’t merely drift to the poles and merge. (As an example, Saturn has a single cyclone at every of its poles. ) “All earlier theories predicted that polar areas of big planets ought to be dominated by massive cyclones over their poles, like what’s being noticed at Saturn, or stay chaotic,” mentioned Li, who’s taking a brand new place on the College of Michigan at Ann Arbor. “What we see at Jupiter means these earlier theories are incorrect, and we want one thing new. ” Associated: Essentially the most highly effective storms of the photo voltaic system (photographs) To make clear Jupiter’s cyclones, Li and his colleagues developed pc fashions primarily based on what Juno revealed in regards to the sizes and speeds of the storms. They targeted on what elements would possibly maintain these geometric patterns secure over time with out merging. The researchers discovered the steadiness of those patterns rely partly on how deep the cyclones attain down into Jupiter’s ambiance, however totally on anticyclonic rings round every cyclone — that’s, a hoop of wind spinning in the wrong way that every cyclone is whirling in. Too little shielding from anticyclone rings led to the cyclones merge; an excessive amount of shielding may drive the cyclones aside from one another. There are numerous unsolved mysteries concerning these clusters of cyclones. For instance, it stays unknown why Jupiter’s vortexes occur to occupy this completely satisfied center between an excessive amount of and too little shielding. “Proper now we do not know what makes them sit on this candy spot,” Li mentioned. The scientists are actually investigating how these cyclones may need shaped within the first place. One risk is that they shaped close to the poles, the place they’re at present positioned. The opposite, “which we predict is extra probably, is that they shaped elsewhere after which migrated to the poles,” Li mentioned. This picture captured by NASA’s Juno spacecraft in November 2019 exhibits six cyclones organized in a hexagonal sample at Jupiter’s south pole. For scale, a top level view of the continental United States is superimposed over the central cyclone with a top level view of Texas over the most recent cyclone. (Picture credit score: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/ASI/INAF/JIRAM) As soon as the researchers generate pc fashions primarily based on knowledge from Juno to see which of those formation eventualities is extra probably, they will then start to see how these cyclones arrange themselves into these secure patterns. This will likely show a tougher query to reply, “as a result of that entails detailed 3-D modeling of how these vortices are generated, and there are a variety of parameters about these vortices we have no idea, reminiscent of their vertical construction,” Li mentioned. “However we are able to attempt completely different eventualities to see which vertical constructions would possibly generate the wind velocity profiles we have now noticed with these cyclones and transfer ahead from there. ” The scientists detailed their findings on-line Sept. 7 within the journal Proceedings of the Nationwide Academy of Sciences.

The announcement was made by Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Sunday where he revealed that the mission to Moon will not include an orbiter like the Chandrayaan-2. But, it will include a rover and a lander. Chandrayaan-2’s Vikram Lander crashed last year and its debris was found later on by NASA. Following the unsuccessful landing on Moon’s south pole, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) had said that it has plans to launch another mission to the Moon in 2020. Recently, data from the ISRO suggested that Moon might be rusting. In the study, it is mentioned that the moon is turning slightly red, which indicates that there is a formation of a reddish-black mineral form of iron named hematite on its surface, especially at the poles. Jitendra Singh, Minister of State (MoS) for the Department of Space said Chandrayaan-1 which was launched in 2008 has transmitted images suggesting Moon may be rusting. “The sign of this finding is that even though the surface of the Moon is known to have iron-rich rocks, it is not known for the presence of water and oxygen, which are the two elements needed to interact with iron to create rust,” Singh said. On the other hand, NASA’s JPL scientists Abigail Fraeman and Vivian Sun were surprised by the findings of Chandrayaan-1 “very puzzling”. They added: “At first, I totally didn’t believe it. It shouldn’t exist based on the conditions present on the Moon,” Fraeman said. “But since we discovered water on the Moon, people have been speculating that there could be a greater variety of minerals than we realize if that water had reacted with rocks. ” Also, the training processes and other procedures for India’s first-ever Human Space mission Gaganyaan despite the situation created by the pandemic. Singh said, “Constraints due to the COVID pandemic led to some disruptions in the plan for Gaganyaan but efforts are going on to stick to the timeline of around 2022. ” Express Tech is now on Telegram.

    "title": "Giant particle accelerator in the sky",
    "body": "2020/09/11 - Credit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain The Earth’s magnetic field traps high-energy particles. When the first satellites were launched into space, scientists led by James Van Allen unexpectedly discovered the high-energy particle radiation regions, which were later named after its discoverer: the Van Allen Radiation Belts. Visualized, these look like two donut-shaped regions encompassing the planet. Now, a new study led by researchers from GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences shows that electrons in the radiation belts can be accelerated to very high speeds locally. The study shows that magnetosphere works as a very efficient particle accelerator, speeding up electrons to so-called ultra-relativistic energies. The study conducted by Hayley Allison, a postdoctoral scholar at GFZ Potsdam, and Yuri Shprits from GFZ and Professor at the University of Potsdam, is published in Nature Communications. To better understand the origin of the Van Allen Belts, in 2012, NASA launched the Van Allen Probes twin spacecraft to traverse this most harsh environment and conduct detailed measurements in this hazardous region. The measurements included a full range of particles moving at different speeds and in different directions, and plasma waves. Plasma waves are similar to the waves that we see on the water surface, but are invisible to the naked eye. They can be compared to ripples in the electric and magnetic field. Recent observations revealed that the energy of electrons in the belts can go up to so called ultra-relativistic energies. These electrons, with temperatures above 100 billion degrees Fahrenheit, move so quickly that their energy of motion is much higher than their energy of rest given by Einstein’s famous formula E=mc2. They are so fast that the time significantly slows down for these particles. Scientists were surprised to find these ultra-relativistic electrons and assumed that such high energies can be only reached by a combination of two processes: the inward transport of particles from the outer regions of the magnetosphere, which accelerates them, and a local acceleration of particles by plasma waves. However, the new study shows that electrons reach such incredible energies locally, in the heart of the belts, by taking all this energy from plasma waves. This process turns out to be extremely efficient. The unexpected discovery of how acceleration of particles to ultra-relativistic energies operates in the near-Earth space may help scientists understand the fundamental processes of acceleration on the sun, near outer planets, and even in the distant corners of the universe, where space probes cannot reach.

    "title": "How hydrogen behaves on Saturn and Jupiter ",
    "body": "2020/09/11 - Hydrogen, the simplest and most abundant element in the Universe, develops a remarkably complex behavior upon compression. Since Wigner predicted the dissociation and metallization of solid Hydrogen at megabar pressures almost a century ago, several efforts have been made to explain the many unusual properties of dense Hydrogen, including a rich and poorly understood substantial polymorphism, an anomalous melting line, and the possible transition to a superconducting state. Professor Michele Ceriotti, heads the Laboratory of Computational Science and Modelling (COSMO) within EPFL‘s School of Engineering and colleagues from the University of Cambridge and IBM Zurich, have used computer simulations to understand the nature of this elusive transition. Scientists used AI to make a significant breakthrough in understanding how Hydrogen behaves on Saturn and Jupiter. Professor Ceriotti said, “Hydrogen is the simplest element on the periodic table: it’s made of one proton and one electron. That’s one reason why scientists study it so much. What makes this phenomenon on giant planets fairly unique – and interesting – is that the transition is between two forms of a liquid state, not from a liquid to a gaseous or solid-state. ” Ceriotti said, “This transition has been the focus of an intense research effort – many research groups have tried to gain a better understanding by replicating it in a laboratory. But that’s really difficult because you have to create the same conditions here on Earth as those on Saturn and Jupiter, which means achieving pressures that are around a million times greater than that of the Earth’s atmosphere and then analyzing samples that have been exposed to those pressures. As you can imagine, examining compounds under those conditions isn’t easy. Various studies have been conducted, but their findings are often controversial because they differ substantially from each other. ” Instead of recreating giant planets’ atmospheric conditions in a lab, scientists used highly precise computer models to simulate them digitally. Past endeavors to do so included solving on the fly equations depicting the quantum mechanical behavior of fluid Hydrogen. The intricacy of such conditions restricted the extent of such simulations to only a couple of atoms one after another and the time scale to short of what one billionth of a second. Using computer simulation and machine-learning-based models, scientists expanded the scope and time scale of their simulations and gain insight into the mechanisms at work in the hydrogen transition. That required using very powerful computers. Ceriotti said, “It was a considerable investment in terms of time and energy. Running our models – which we developed using machine learning – took several weeks on EPFL’s supercomputers. But if we’d tried to run models developed the conventional way, it would’ve taken hundreds of millions of years. ” The outcomes explain why previous studies produced such different results, which might be traced to the interpretation of experimental observations and the liquid-liquid transition nature. Ceriotti said, “Until now, all the studies that tried to model Hydrogen’s behavior on giant planets assumed that the transition from an insulating to a metallic form was clear-cut. But our simulations indicate that the transition takes place gradually. As a consequence, the exact moment where the transition occurs depends on the choice of criteria, and the observable being monitored – which could explain the dependence on the details of the experiments. ” “Now that we’ve modeled the ‘ideal’ system, our next step will be to study more realistic – and therefore more complex – conditions, where Hydrogen is mixed with helium and other compounds in the planets’ atmospheres. ” Journal Reference: "

The company was drilling to find gold, but instead, discovered something more precious and historic. The impact crater is believed to have a 5 km diameter and this massive crater was not visible from the surface; it was found using electromagnetic surveys by the investigators. The crater was found in the town of Ora Banda, north-west of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, which is known for Goldfields mining. According to the experts, this crater is nearly five times bigger than the world-famous Wolfe Creek crater, which is in the Kimberley. The discovery of this yet-to-be-named crater has rocked the world of geophysicists and geologists. According to Dr. Jayson Meyers, a geologist and geophysicist, this discovery is quite unexpected and significant at the same time. The geologist said, “This discovery was made in an area where the landscape is very flat. You wouldn’t know it was there because the crater has been filled in over geological time. ”Evolution Mining, Australia’s third largest gold-mining firm, found this crater while digging for gold. The crater’s diameter is 5 km, and therefore, it is believed to be the largest meteorite craters in the world. As per Dr. Meyers, the meteorite that formed this crater must be somewhere between 320 to 660 ft in diameter. He also said that new technologies have made things a lot easier for scientists to make these discoveries. According to him, there are probably more such craters waiting to be discovered. "

Tremblay also explained that their dataset found no technosignatures, which means there is no intelligent life sign. The researchers pointed out that they’ve only searched a comparatively tiny portion of outer space. Steven Tingay, a professor from the International Center for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) in Perth, said that in The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams noted that “space is big, really big. ” The new study is comparable to the size of a “large swimming pool” Although the study is a big one, Dr. Trembaly said that the area of space the astronomers observed is just like looking for an object in the oceans, but only searching an amount of water, comparable to a large backyard swimming pool. She added that although there is still much to learn in finding extraterrestrial life, new technologies such as the MWA telescope are continuously pushing the limits. “We have to keep looking,” she said. On the other hand, the team also studied the sky in a supernova remnant, located in Vela’s Southern constellation, where six known exoplanets are around.

The asteroid is expected to fly past at a speed of nearly 38,620 kmph (24,000 mph) and come within a distance of 6. 8 million kms (4. 2 million miles). The asteroid could be as big as the iconic London Eye or bigger than a professional football field.

Asteroid 2020 QL2 is currently travelling at 10. 5 kilometres per second (6. 52 miles per second). Considering its size and close proximity to Earth, Asteroid 2020 QL2 is considered “potentially hazardous” by NASA. However, it has almost no chances of hitting the Earth. Space objects that come within 0. 05 astronomical units (4. 6 million miles) and measure more than 140 meters (460 feet) in diameter are labelled “potentially hazardous,” as per CNEOS. Going by this, the Asteroid 2020 QL2 comes close to be considered the same. However, considering its current path, the asteroid will pass at a distance roughly ten times the distance between the Moon and the Earth. Hence, it has almost no chances of hitting Earth.

    "body": "2020/09/11 - FP Trending The camera core of the Vera C Rubin Observatory has clicked its first test 3,200-megapixels digital photos – the largest ever taken in a single shot. According to a statement by SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, the images are so large that it would take 378 4K ultra-high-definition TV screens to display one of them in full size. It added that the resolution is so massive that one could see a golf ball from about 24 kilometres away. The statement said that the sensor array will be integrated into the world’s largest digital camera at SLAC and once observed in the Rubin Observatory in Chile, it will produce panoramic images of the complete Southern sky, once every night for 10 years. Big News! The @VRubinObs LSST Camera team at @SLAClab has released the first images taken using the LSST Camera focal plane—these are the first 3200 megapixel images ever taken as single shots! See all the images at https://t. co/f0Hk3PWTVy pic. twitter. com/2INrt8NnTB — Rubin Observatory (@VRubinObs) September 8, 2020 The camera will feed data into the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), using which the observatory will create the largest astronomical movie of all time to shed light on some of the biggest mysteries of the universe, including dark matter and energy. Vincent Riot, LSST Camera project manager from DOE’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory said that it is a huge milestone for them, adding, “The focal plane will produce the images for the LSST, so it’s the capable and sensitive eye of the Rubin Observatory. ” SLAC’s Steven Kahn, director of the observatory added that the achievement is among the most significant of the entire Rubin Observatory. Kahn said that the completion of the LSST Camera focal plane and its successful tests is a huge victory by the camera team. This will enable Rubin Observatory to deliver next-generation astronomical science. The first 3,200 MP images are of a variety of objects including a head of Romanesco – a type of broccoli – that was chosen for its very detailed surface structure. SLAC’s Aaron Roodman, who is responsible for the assembly and testing of the LSST Camera, stated that taking the images is a major accomplishment, adding that they managed to push the limits of what’s possible by taking advantage of every square millimetre of the focal plane and maximising the science of what can be done with it.

(Image courtesy of Don Banfield/Christ Eckert) NASA is studying how it can harness wind power on Mars. This is following plans to deploy a future Mars polar lander during the planet’s dark winter period, which typically lasts around 300 days. The Planet Turbine Anemometer (PTA) is currently one of the concepts vying for NASA development funding. Besides supplying power, the wind turbine will also be responsible for measuring and documenting wind speed, temperature and atmospheric pressure. “The beauty of our concept is that the turbine measures wind speeds and produces power,” said Isaac Smith, PTA concept study lead and a researcher at the Planetary Science Institute in Lakewood, Colorado. “Thus, we don’t have to take nuclear power to an ice cap for when the Sun goes down. ” The goal is to be able to use the wind force on Mars to generate sufficient milliwatts of electricity needed to keep the polar lander’s instruments functioning throughout. Mars has less than 1 percent of Earth’s atmosphere. While winds on Mars can reach approximately 20 meters per second, 10 times the wind speed on Earth would be required to reach the equivalent force of wind. This means that a 0. 5 meters per second wind on earth has the same force as a 5 meters per second wind on Mars. That also depends on where exactly one lands, particularly on geographic slopes that tend to have faster winds, according to Smith. The data collected will also be used to study how Mars’ polar layered deposits form and evolve during a Martian year. The turbine design will feature a 1. 5-meter-tall tower that can be folded and stored on the deck of the lander until it can be safely deployed on the Mars surface. The 2-meter diameter turbine blades will use an explosive bolt mechanism to lock into place. According to Don Banfield, a member of the PTA concept study team and Cornell University planetary scientist, they’re also looking forward to one day seeing a network of wind-powered weather stations on Mars. That would enable Mars climate researchers to gain extensive information of how dust storms grow and spread on the planet, as well as insight on how topography influences regional dust and wind flows, temperature, and solar illumination. Smith added that it is imperative to understand Mars’ wind patterns and atmospheric processes to have safer landings in the future. However, they also share that they would “love to have a dozen or so of these [PTAs] on the polar caps” for the meantime. The PTA proposal was submitted to NASA back in July as part of their Maturation of Instruments for Solar System Exploration (MatISSE) program. The PTA team includes partners from Ball Aerospace, MIT Haystack Observatory and Cornell University. For more news and stories, check out this summer’s contenders on the race to Mars here. "

    "title": "Binge drinkers brains have to work harder to feel empathy for others",
    "body": "2020/09/11 - Washington D. C. [USA], September 10 (ANI): People who binge-drink show more extensive dysfunction across their brains than previously realised, a new study from the University of Sussex has shown. The research shows that binge-drinkers’ brains have to put more effort into trying to feel empathy for other people in pain. The paper ‘Differential brain responses for the perception of pain during the empathic response in binge drinkers compared to non-binge drinkers’ is published in the October 2020 edition of the Neuroimage: Clinical journal. The study involved 71 participants (from France and the UK) whose brain activity was observed in fMRI scanners while undertaking a pain perception task. Half of these people were classified as binge-drinkers and half were not. The binge-drinkers were sober while they were being observed. In the task, participants were shown an image of a limb being injured and asked to imagine either that the body part was theirs, or that of another person, and to state how much pain was associated with the image. The binge-drinking participants struggled more than their non-binge-drinking counterparts when trying to adopt the perspective of another person experiencing the pain: they took more time to respond and the scans revealed that their brains had to work harder – to use more neural resources – to appreciate how intensely another person would feel pain. The study also revealed a more widespread dysfunction than previously realised; a visual area of the brain, which is involved in recognising body parts, showed unusually high levels of activation in the binge-drinkers. This was not true in the non-binge drinkers who looked at the same images. When the binge-drinkers were asked to imagine the injured body part in the picture as their own, their pain estimate was not different from that of their non-binge drinking counterparts. “I have been studying the effects of drinking excessive alcohol for many years. In that time I have built up a strong body of evidence about the widespread way in which binge-drinking is associated with brain dysfunction in areas supporting self-control and attention. Our aim with the present study was to examine whether binge drinkers show less empathy and their brains show different responses to non-binge drinkers when they imagine another person in pain,” said Professor Theodora Duka from the School of Psychology at the University of Sussex. “Reduced empathy in binge drinkers may facilitate drinking as it can blunt the perception of the suffering of self or others during a drinking session. We have shown with this study that dysfunction associated with binge drinking is even more extensive than previously known. A region of the brain called the Fusiform Body Area associated with the recognition of body parts showed hyperactivity in binge-drinkers in a situation in which feelings of empathy are experienced,” added Duka. “Our results are quite surprising. Our data show that binge-drinkers need to work harder to feel empathy for other people in pain. They need to use more resources in terms of higher brain activity than non-binge drinkers. What this means in everyday life is that people who binge-drink might struggle to perceive the pain of others as easily as non-binge drinkers do,” Dr Charlotte Rae from the School of Psychology at the University of Sussex said. “It’s not that binge drinkers feel less empathy – it’s just that they have to put more brain resources into being able to do so. However, under certain circumstances when resources become limited, binge drinkers may struggle to engage in empathic response to others,” added Rae Bring drinking is defined as consuming more than 60 g of pure alcohol – (equivalent to about three-quarters of one bottle of wine, or 2 1/2 pints of lager) on at least one occasion in the past 30 days. About 30 percent of all adults (over 15 years of age) who drink alcohol in the UK and France meet this criterion. (ANI) "

    "title": "Research team discovers unique supernova explosion",
    "body": "2020/09/11 - Washington [US], September 11 (ANI): One-hundred million light-years away from Earth, an unusual supernova is exploding. That exploding star – which is known as ‘Supernova LSQ14fmg’ – was the faraway object discovered by a 37-member international research team led by Florida State University Assistant Professor of Physics Eric Hsiao. Their research, which was published in The Astrophysical Journal, helped uncover the origins of the group of supernovae this star belongs to. This supernova’s characteristics – it gets brighter extremely slowly, and it is also one of the brightest explosions in its class – are unlike any other. “This was a truly unique and strange event, and our explanation for it is equally interesting,” said Hsiao, the paper’s lead author. The exploding star is what is known as a Type Ia supernova, and more specifically, a member of the ‘super-Chandrasekhar’ group. Stars go through a sort of life cycle, and these supernovae are the exploding finale of some stars with low mass. They are so powerful that they shape the evolution of galaxies, and so bright that we can observe them from Earth even halfway across the observable universe. Type Ia supernovae were crucial tools for discovering what’s known as dark energy, which is the name given to the unknown energy that causes the current accelerated expansion of the universe. Despite their importance, astronomers knew little about the origins of these supernova explosions, other than that they are the thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf stars. But the research team knew that the light from a Type Ia supernova rises and falls over the course of weeks, powered by the radioactive decay of nickel produced in the explosion. A supernova of that type would get brighter as the nickel becomes more exposed, then fainter as the supernova cools and the nickel decays to cobalt and to iron. After collecting data with telescopes in Chile and Spain, the research team saw that the supernova was hitting some material surrounding it, which caused more light to be released along with the light from the decaying nickel. They also saw evidence that carbon monoxide was being produced. Those observations led to their conclusion – the supernova was exploding inside what had been an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star on the way to becoming a planetary nebula. “Seeing how the observation of this interesting event agrees with the theory is very exciting,” said Jing Lu, an FSU doctoral candidate and a co-author of the paper. They theorized that the explosion was triggered by the merger of the core of the AGB star and another white dwarf star orbiting within it. The central star was losing a copious amount of mass through a stellar wind before the mass loss was turned off abruptly and created a ring of material surrounding the star. Soon after the supernova exploded, it impacted a ring of material often seen in planetary nebulae and produced the extra light and the slow brightening observed. “This is the first strong observational proof that a Type Ia supernova can explode in a post-AGB or proto-planetary-nebula system and is an important step in understanding the origins of Type Ia supernovae,” Hsiao said. “These supernovae can be particularly troublesome because they can mix into the sample of normal supernovae used to study dark energy. This research gives us a better understanding of the possible origins of Type Ia supernovae and will help to improve future dark energy research. ” (ANI) "

    "body": "2020/09/11 -  Advertisement -The Moon is constantly being studied for a variety of reasons. Of all the countries that are capable of undertaking missions of such complexity, a mission to the Moon is an absolute necessity. The major reason behind this is that researchers expect space travel to become so cost-effective that mining the moon for its resources could become a reality. It is often said that the first person to mine anything outside of Earth will become the first trillionaire, which is not a speculation. Many observation satellites are currently in the orbit of our natural satellite, hoping to learn more about it. The Moon showed signs of rusting only on the poles. A discovery has been made while studying the data from ISRO’s Chandrayaan-1 mission that was launched in 2008. The new research suggests that the Moon is turning slightly red. The reddish colour was observed on the poles, where the researchers suspect that a reddish-black mineral form of iron named as hematite is being formed due to some phenomenon. For iron to turn into hematite, two key ingredients are required, water and oxygen. While it has a lot of iron, the satellite does not have much water, and oxygen is almost non-existent in its atmosphere. The researchers who came across this are from the University of Hawaii. The phenomenon itself is very puzzling because the environment over there is the farthest from being conducive to hematite formation. The initial speculation suggests that the culprit could be Earth’s atmosphere.  Advertisement -The data that revealed this was recorded by the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3). The data showed a stark contrast between the poles and the rest of the surface. The Moon gets a steady supply of hydrogen from the Solar winds. However, this had to be ruled out as the reason because Hydrogen has the exact opposite effect of Oxygen when it comes to rust. Earth’s Magnetotail. The only other option was the Oxygen from Earth’s atmosphere. However, to explain how it reached The Moon, researchers had to take the help of a 2007 study, which pointed out that Oxygen from Earth’s upper atmosphere could potentially travel through the magnetotail to the Moon. The Magnetotail also blocks 99% of the Hydrogen from Solar winds during certain phases of the Moon’s orbit, which could have counteracted the rusting process. The fact that the moon is moving away from Earth means that the rusting process is slowing down and might even stop one day. The fact that water was only found on the poles means that rusting can only happen on the poles as well. In light of the new facts, we know more about our natural satellite, which could come in handy.

    "title": "Global Warming Beyond Earth Jupiter s Moons May Be Warming Each Other And That May Create Oceans",
    "body": "2020/09/11 - Jupiter could now be facing some of its own global warming issues. It turns out that Jupiter’s moons could be warming each other, in what is known as a process called tidal heating. This where Jupiter and its moons interact with each other during gravitational tugs which sees the planet and the moon exert pressure in either direction. Till now, it was believed that the planet itself was responsible for the tidal heating process, but the newest research indicates that moon to moon interactions are responsible for the heating up. The new study published in the Geophysical Research Letters suggest that some of Jupiter’s otherwise icy moons contain interiors warm enough to host oceans, which means liquid water. “Maintaining subsurface oceans against freezing over geological times requires a fine balance between internal heating and heat loss, and yet we have several pieces of evidence that Europa, Ganymede, Callisto and other moons should be ocean worlds. Io, the moon closest to Jupiter, shows widespread volcanic activity, another consequence of tidal heating, but at a higher intensity likely experienced by other terrestrial planets, like Earth, in their early history,” says Antony Trinh, a postdoctoral research fellow in the Lunar and Planetary Lab and the co-author of the study, as reported by Phys. org. The study says that when the tides generated by other objects in Jupiter’s moon system match each moon’s resonant frequencies, the moon will start to heat up. This results in melting of ice or rock internally. These tides can raise more heating than the tides raised by Jupiter. “Basically, if you push any object or system and let go, it will wobble at its own natural frequency. If you keep on pushing the system at the right frequency, those oscillations get bigger and bigger, just like when you’re pushing a swing. If you push the swing at the right time, it goes higher, but get the timing wrong and the swing’s motion is dampened,” says Hamish Hay, now a postdoctoral fellow at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. He is the lead author of the study. Another study led by Edward Ashton from the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of British Columbia, suggests that Jupiter may have as many as 600 small irregular moons orbiting it.

    "title": "Holding up mirror to a dark matter discrepancy",
    "body": "2020/09/11 - Washington [US], September 11 (ANI): The universe’s funhouse mirrors are revealing a difference between how dark matter behaves in theory and how it appears to act in reality. Dark matter is the invisible glue that keeps stars bound together inside a galaxy. It makes up most of a galaxy’s mass and creates an invisible scaffold that tethers galaxies to form clusters. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light. It does not interact with any known particles. Its presence is known only through its gravitational pull on the visible matter in space. Although dark matter is lightly smeared throughout the universe, it is heaped in regions of space called galaxy clusters. Each of these massive clusters, held together by gravity, is made up of about 1,000 individual galaxies — each of which carries its own dollop of dark matter. In a new study in the journal Science, Yale astrophysicist Priyamvada Natarajan and a team of international researchers analysed Hubble Space Telescope images from several massive galaxy clusters and found that the smaller dollops of dark matter associated with cluster galaxies were significantly more concentrated than predicted by theorists. The finding implies there may be a missing ingredient in scientists’ understanding of dark matter. “There’s a feature of the real universe that we are simply not capturing in our current theoretical models,” said Natarajan, a senior author of the study and a professor of astronomy and physics at Yale. “This could signal a gap in our current understanding of the nature of dark matter and its properties, as this exquisite data has permitted us to probe the detailed distribution of dark matter on the smallest scales. ” Astronomers are able to “map” the distribution of dark matter within galaxy clusters via the bending of light the galaxies produce — a concept called gravitational lensing. Like a funhouse mirror, gravitational lensing distorts the shapes of background galaxies that appear in telescope images of cluster galaxies. The higher the concentration of dark matter in a cluster, the more dramatic the observed lensing effects. The researchers used images from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope, coupled with spectroscopy from the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope, to produce high-fidelity dark-matter maps. Hubble Space Telescope image of the lensing cluster MACSJ1206. The inset shows the derived detailed spatial distribution of dark matter — the heaped mountain range dotted with small peaks. The Hubble image reveals lensing features on large, distorted arcs (produced by dark matter) and the event produced by smaller-scaled dark matter clumps (shown in the thumbnail images). HST Image Credit: NASA, ESA, G. Caminha (University of Groningen), M. Meneghetti (Observatory of Astrophysics and Space Science of Bologna), P. Natarajan (Yale University), and the CLASH team. A 3D view of the data showed the presence of dark matter hills, mounds, and valleys. From this perspective, the mapped dark matter looks like a mountain range, with peaked regions. The peaks are the dollops of dark matter associated with individual cluster galaxies. The especially high quality of the study’s data allowed the researchers to test whether these dark matter landscapes matched theory-based computer simulations of galaxy clusters with similar masses, located at roughly the same distances. What they discovered was that the simulations did not show any of the same levels of dark-matter concentration on the smallest scales — the scales associated with individual cluster galaxies. “To me personally, detecting a gnawing gap — a factor of 10 discrepancies in this case — between observation and theoretical prediction is very exciting,” Natarajan said. “A key goal of my research has been testing theoretical models with the improving quality of data to find these gaps. It’s these kinds of gaps and anomalies that have often revealed that either we were missing something in the current theory, or it points the way to a brand-new model, which will have more explanatory power. ” Natarajan has spent more than a decade confronting theoretical models of dark matter with data from gravitational lensing. “The quality of data and the sophistication of models have only now converged to permit stress testing of the cold dark matter paradigm, and it has revealed a crack,” she said. Natarajan said the team, which includes researchers from Italy, the Netherlands, and Denmark, plans to continue stress testing theories of the nature of dark matter.

    "title": "There Is More To Theory in Biology Than Replicating the Results of Experiments",
    "body": "2020/09/11 - Photo: Taofeek Obafemi-Babatunde/Unsplash. I have always thought of theory in biology as disciplined dreaming. The discipline comes from the challenge of creatively marrying the rules of mathematics and physics with what is known of fundamental biological principles. In biology, we face problems that seem inexplicable, or at least deeply puzzling. Theoretical studies can lead the way to explore potential explanations for these problems. As an experimentalist, I have been grateful that computational models can free us from the idiosyncrasies of the particular system we study. I learned this many years ago when I asked Tom Kepler, then a postdoc, to model the results of experiments on electrically coupled oscillators that Scott Hooper and I had published several years earlier: we had found that an isolated oscillatory neuron was faster when its electrically coupled neighbours were removed (Hooper and Marder, 1987). Tom’s first simulations showed the exact opposite and I told him he must have made a mistake! He was rightfully miffed, but returned shortly with simulations which showed that both results were possible, depending on the ratio of the inward and outward currents in the model (Kepler et al. , 1990). For me, the deep take-home message of this exercise was that I had no idea that there were two cases: that an oscillator, depending on the details of how it is built, could go either faster or slower when depolarised! Because of the specific properties of the neurons we had initially studied, we had seen only one of the two possible cases and mistakenly thought that result was general. Several years later, now knowing that both cases were possible, we recognised that a different cell type showed the second case (Weimann et al. , 1993). Thus, for me as a biologist, theory is valuable because it enables us to ask which of our results are likely to be general and which depend on the particular characteristics of our experimental system. We can also use theory to ask the following question: how might a biological system solve a particular problem? In the early 1990s many neuroscientists were struck by how difficult it was to ‘tune’ neuronal models – that is, to find parameters that would, at least loosely, replicate the biological systems they were meant to represent. On the other hand, biological neurons find good solutions, so clearly they were not randomly sampling parameter space, but had rules or mechanisms that allowed them to find such solutions. But how? It was already clear that neurons could maintain stable properties for many years, despite the continuous turnover of membrane proteins. Our first models to tackle this problem of feedback regulation of intrinsic excitability, or homeostatic regulation of neuronal excitability, suggested that a simple negative feedback system with an activity sensor that controlled channel density, akin to other homeostatic processes that control temperature or blood pressure, might provide a plausible explanation (LeMasson et al. , 1993). Almost thirty years later, there have been thousands of studies in an intellectual lineage that follows that initial framing of the question (Turrigiano, 2017). The initial model was useful because it drew attention to a biological conundrum in a concise manner, and because it triggered investigators to do experiments they might not have otherwise done, not because it was biologically correct in its details. Many others have written cogently about the importance of theory in biology (see, for example, Goldstein, 2018). However, my reasons for writing this article are not just to extol the virtues of theory, but to explore the additional challenges that theory manuscripts and grant applications seem to experience during peer review. You might imagine that theorists would be free spirits, letting their imaginations roam free to conjure and appreciate interesting hypotheses that can drive new ways of thinking about difficult biological problems. Instead, I am struck that theorists (as well as experimentalists) – when acting as reviewers – seem to often ask for direct connection to known biological data, and are frequently critical of theory papers. Why might this occur? Experimentalists know how difficult it can be to collect data if they don’t have the necessary tools, or if the experiment would take years to perform, so it is helpful when there is a theoretical study that points to a path through the maze of all possible future experiments. A well-designed theoretical study can also help an experimentalist to work out which features of any set of results likely approach a new general principle: a theory that does no more than replicate an existing experimental data set is unlikely to help with this endeavour. Also read: The Most Important Scientific Problems Have Yet to Be Solved So why are so many smart reviewers constantly asking for data that corroborate the theory before the theory is even published? I imagine that theorists are aware that one could construct and study innumerable problems that would provide little new insight. Thus, one can see this as a request for reassurance that the theoretical study at hand has the potential to illuminate a biological problem. I argue that the issue is not whether there are extant data, but whether the paper provides a novel concept, large or small, into a problem yet to be understood. Ironically, a theory paper that ‘solves’ a difficult problem with a simple, transparent, and elegant solution can be easily devalued. It can take months or years of work to come to a result, which once understood, seems simple, and perhaps obvious. All of the underlying work and the multiple fruitless avenues of exploration may not show, once the answer is clear. And if the answer is a few simple differential equations or calculations, the reader might feel that they could have done the work in two hours, not remembering that until it had been done, no one knew the solution, or that it was an interesting problem. Indeed, it can be easy to mistake the complexity of the mathematics in a theory paper for the importance of the new biological insight that ensues. Which isn’t to say that, for those capable of understanding the mathematics, that there isn’t deep value in work that requires innovative and sophisticated calculations. Likewise, a low-tech experiment might give more new insight than a more technologically demanding one. Again, it is important to not be fooled by complexity of method when evaluating the value of a scientific result. It is rare for there to be a clear point at which any scientific problem is ‘finished’. So the decision of what constitutes ‘a paper’ is always a judgment call. However, when reviewing manuscripts many of us are guilty of focusing on the paper we would have written rather than paying attention to the one written by the authors (Marder, 2020). This is especially true for theory papers that often seem to be evaluated in terms of what the reviewer might consider the most interesting path to take, rather than the path taken. Ironically, if the manuscript is successful, there should be endless new directions to pursue, some of which may look to be more interesting or prove to be more fruitful than those taken initially by the authors. But many of these paths will only appear to be interesting or potentially fruitful because of the insights provided by the authors in the submitted manuscript. We should be grateful for those theory papers that at once answer a question and pose new ones. Eve Marder is at the Volen Center and the Biology Department, Brandeis University, Waltham, US.

Having rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is known to at least double the chances of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) because of links to atherosclerosis (a build-up of plaque inside the arteries), heart failure and strokes. The study, published in the journal Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, linked treatment of RA with improvements in vascular stiffness - an indicator of CVD. “Our research shows that even at the earliest stages of rheumatoid arthritis, there is increased vascular stiffness in people with no or minimal traditional CVD risk factors such as hypertension, high cholesterol or smoking,” said study author Sven Plein from the University of Leeds in the UK. For the study, the research team had set out to explore possible connections between the very earliest signs of RA and indicators of CVD. Detailed MRI heart scans were given to 82 patients with no known heart issues. The scans revealed the presence of increased vascular stiffness in the aorta, which is a gradual loss of elasticity in the large arteries, compared to healthy people. There was also evidence of cardiac scarring and changes in the wall of the left ventricle (the heart’s main pumping chamber), suggesting heart abnormalities had started before the RA diagnosis. After their initial scans, the 82 patients were given one of two RA drug courses. After a year of treatment, further scans were then carried out on 71 of the patients. The scans revealed that the vascular stiffness of the aorta (the main artery) had improved during the RA therapy. “The rheumatoid arthritis treatment improved vascular stiffness, regardless of how the patient responded to the RA medication and these improvements in vascular stiffness independently of response to RA treatment were unexpected,” Plein said. The research highlights the importance of commencing treatment of RA early to also lessen the risk of developing CVD. “Identifying patients at the earliest stage of RA with most risk of CVD is important to inform management strategy,” said study researcher Maya Buch. “The benefits of RA treatment on CVD extend beyond traditional suppression of inflammation,” Buch noted.

    "body": "2020/09/08 - Glucoregulatory neurons within the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus-median eminence of the brain are enmeshed by extracellular matrices known as perineuronal nets that can profoundly impact neuronal function. Latest findings implicate these structures in both brain control of glucose homeostasis and as potential targets for diabetes treatment. Credit: KImberly Alonge/Schwartz Lab/UW Medicine Diabetes Research Institute In rodents with type 2 diabetes, a single surgical injection of a protein called fibroblast growth factor 1 can restore blood sugar levels to normal for weeks or months. Yet how this growth factor acts in the brain to generate this lasting benefit has been poorly understood. Clarifying how this occurs might lead to more effective diabetes treatments that tap into the brain’s inherent potential to ameliorate the condition. “Until recently, the brain’s ability to normalize elevated blood sugar levels in diabetic animals was unrecognized,” said Dr. Michael Schwartz, professor of medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine and co-director of the UW Medicine Diabetes Institute. “By interrogating cellular and molecular responses induced in the hypothalamus by a brain peptide called fibroblast growth factor 1, our international teams’ latest findings chart a path towards a more complete understanding how this effect is achieved. “These insights,” he said, “may one day inform therapeutic strategies for inducing sustained diabetes remission, rather than simply lowering blood sugar levels on a day-to-day basis as current treatments do. ” Type 2 diabetes affects 10% of the U. S. population. It is closely tied to obesity and causes serious health problems including heart disease, vision loss, kidney failure, dementia, difficult-to-cure infections, and nerve damage. It also increases the risk of needing amputations. Control of blood sugar levels can prevent these problems, but is often hard to achieve and becomes an ongoing struggle for many patients. In two companion papers in the Sept. 7 editions of Nature Communications and Nature Metabolism, international teams of researchers describe the intricate biology of the brain’s response to fibroblast growth factor 1. The first team describes robust cellular responses that appear to safeguard brain-signaling pathways critical to keeping blood sugar in check. A second team, containing some of the same researchers, made discoveries about extracellular matrix assemblies called “perineuronal nets” that enmesh groups of neurons involved in blood sugar control. The investigators learned that fibroblast growth factor 1 repairs perineuronal nets that have been damaged by diabetes. This response is required for diabetes remission to be sustained. Dr. Tunes Pers, of the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, University of Copenhagen in Denmark, and diabetes and obesity researcher Dr. Michael Schwartz at UW Medicine in Seattle were senior authors of the Nature Communications report. The lead authors from their labs were Dr. Marie Bentsen and Dr. Dylan Rausch. The international team of scientists that they assembled began by detailing changes of gene expression induced by fibroblast growth factor 1 treatment across diverse brain cell types located in the hypothalamus. This small region of the brain regulates many body functions, including levels of blood sugar, hunger, food intake, and energy use and storage. The scientists found that glial cells, which not only provide structural support but also help to organize and regulate neurocircuit activity, responded more intensely than did neurons, brain cells known for electrical transmission of information. The researchers also observed enhanced interactions between astrocytes and a subset of neurons that make agouti-related protein (called Agrp neurons). Astrocytes are abundant, star-shaped glial cells that nourish neurons and support their electrical transmissions. Agrp neurons are essential components of the melanocortin signaling system, a brain circuit crucial to control of feeding, body weight and blood sugar. Excessive activation of Agrp neurons is known to dampen melanocortin signaling. This effect has been linked to diabetes development in people and rodents. The researchers noted that prohibiting melancortin signaling after fibroblast growth factor 1 injection into the brain prevents sustained diabetes remission. Among other cell types that responded robustly to fibroblast growth factor 1 are tanycytes, elongated, nutrient-sensing glial cells found only in the hypothalamus. Their contributions to normalizing of glucose levels require additional study. The paper published in Nature Metabolism looked at structures that the scientists called “the previously unrecognized participants” in the mechanism behind fibroblast growth factor 1’s ability to induce diabetes remission. These are the perineuronal nets that enmesh blood sugar-regulating neurons in the hypothalamus, including Agrp neurons. The lead author of this paper is Kim Alonge, acting instructor in medicine at the UW School of Medicine. The senior author is Michael Schwartz. Perineuronal nets promote neurocircuit stability by enmeshing neurons and girding the connections between them. The researchers wanted to know if obesity-related diabetes is associated with structural changes in these perineuronal nets, and whether those could be treated. The research team noted that in the Zucker Diabetes Fatty rat model of type 2 diabetes, these nets are scarce in the hypothalamus compared to rats with normal blood sugar levels, Yet in other parts of the brain the nets are normal. This loss of perineuronal nets was rapidly reversed following a single injection of fibroblast growth factor 1 into the brain. The ability of fibroblast growth factor 1 to ameliorate diabetes was hampered by removing the nets through enzymatic digestion. In contrast, intact perineuronal nets are not required for fibroblast growth factor 1 to affect food intake. These finding identify perineuronal nets as key targets for sustained diabetes remission induced by the action of fibroblast growth factor 1. The researchers speculate that perhaps these nets help to constrain the activity of Agrp neurons and thereby pump up melanocortin signaling. The researchers plan to continue to try to bridge the gap between the cellular (and extracellular) responses to fibroblast growth factor 1 and the normalization of blood sugar levels. This, they hope, may ultimately uncover novel strategies for achieving sustained diabetes remission in patients.

    "title": "Who Should Get a Covid19 Vaccine First Experts Disagree ",
    "body": "2020/09/08 - The world is currently racing to develop a safe, effective, and accessible Covid19 vaccine. While these efforts tout new achievements every day and take us closer to a way out of this pandemic, medical experts and ethicists have also been trying to figure out one important, soon-to-be-pressing question: when we finally do get a Covid19 vaccine, its doses will be limited; so, who will get it first? People who are at high risk of contracting Covid19 and who are at risk for having severe symptoms should be prioritized, according to a proposal published last week by the U. S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. It drew its recommendations from past vaccination attempts during the H1N1 and Ebola outbreaks and outlined four criteria for determining who will get the Covid19 vaccine first — people who are at high risk of acquiring infection, who have a high morbidity and mortality risk, those on whom others depend on for essential work, and who are at most risk of transmitting Covid19 to others. Keeping these criteria in mind, the expert task force laid out four phases of vaccine distribution. The first phase would prioritize frontline workers (such as doctors and nurses) and older adults living together in institutions such as nursing homes, both to protect the group that is most vulnerable to Covid19, and the group that takes care of them. Phase 2 would bring in people who have underlying conditions that make them more susceptible to a severe Covid19 infection, and essential workers in society — food delivery workers, school teachers for example — on whom society depends on to normally function. Phase 3 would focus on young adults who are not severely affected by Covid19 but serve as asymptomatic vectors of transmission, and Phase 4 would bring in the rest of the population not covered by the other phases. This approach, however, was criticized by another group of experts that also released their own global vaccination distribution model last week, published in Science, offering up a ‘Fair Priority Model’ that instead centered social justice and equity, and denounced vaccine nationalism (countries hoarding more vaccine doses than they need for their own citizens). “It’s clear that health care workers aren’t equally high-risk, especially in developed countries, where proper PPE [personal protective equipment] has driven their risk down significantly,” Ezekiel J. Emanuel, one of the authors of the ‘Fair Priority Model’ and chair of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine, tells Scientific American. “The approach is biased toward rich, well-developed countries because those countries have more health care workers per capita and also have more elderly people. ” Related on The Swaddle: Waiting For a Vaccine Cannot be Our Pandemic Response Strategy Instead, the experts urged governments to focus on three main aspects of what equitable distribution could prioritize — “benefiting people and limiting harm, prioritizing the disadvantaged, and equal moral concern. ” This, they wrote, could happen in three phases — first would focus on reducing premature death, especially in poorer countries where it is more prevalent. Second would center the economic and social consequences of the Covid19 pandemic, such as the closure of schools and businesses that impact the livelihoods, and therefore, health, of populations around the world. And finally, the third phase would focus on reducing community transmission, targeted for countries with high transmission rates, geared toward restoring pre-pandemic freedoms and other economic and social activities. “From an ethical standpoint, there’s not a good reason for absolute partiality, where a country covers every one of its citizens before giving any vaccine internationally,” Emanuel says. But, “the problem is: there’s almost no definition of what ‘fair and equitable’ means, specifically in terms of distribution. ” In the interview, Emanuel also criticizes one of the World Health Organization’s proposed vaccine distribution models, which suggested giving the coronavirus vaccine to the top 3% of every country’s population, and then to 20% more, and so on. This, however, doesn’t take into account “that different areas of the world are suffering at different rates. Typically, when you’re giving international assistance, you give it to the people who are suffering most,” Emanuel says. The problem is that making sweeping statements about who is most at risk is a dangerous, and inconclusive practice — frontline workers are exposing themselves to Covid19 every day, but those who have proper PPE are at relatively low risk; older people with comorbidities are at risk, but medical research is unsure just how much a vaccine would help them in mounting a Covid19 immune response in the long run; people with underlying conditions are at risk, but in populations that have a high number of chronic illnesses, should the cancer patient get the vaccine over the person with an autoimmune disease? Experts around the world are currently struggling with these ideas, not just at the national, but also international level. Answering the question — who gets a Covid19 vaccine first? — is not easy, but asking it right now is imperative. "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - According to a report from the World Health Organization, cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, accounting for an estimated 9. 6 million deaths, or one in six deaths. However, the outbreak of Covid-19 has accelerated deaths due to cancer as hospitals are riveted by Covid-19 patients. The implications of the pandemic to the treatment of cancer were discussed in Episode-6 of HEAL-Thy Samvaad organised by the ‘Healthcare Advocacy Group’ — HEAL Foundation. The programme was conducted in association with The International Council for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD) last week. ALSO READ It’s ‘trading one health crisis for another’ Elaborating on the rising death rate of cancer, Harit Chaturvedi, Chairman, Max Institute of Cancer Care, said: “Of course, the obstructions created by Covid-19 for patients with cancer have increased the current death rate of cancer. However, there is no need to worry — but go for treatment positively. ” He added: “Cancer facilities are as safe as they were in pre-Covid times, so don’t delay treatment. ” Nutritional management On the prevention of cancer and the role of nutritional management in its care, Chaturvedi added: “Almost 50 per cent of cancer cases can be prevented if we take care of proper nutrition and a balanced diet. A healthy lifestyle, proper exercise, and intermittent fasting also help prevent cancer. “Addiction to tobacco and high-fat content intake in the diet and faulty lifestyle contributes to 35 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively in the incidence of cancer cases. Fruits, vegetables, yoga &amp; regular exercise help prevent cancer. The role of nutrition is pivotal in cancer prevention,” he added. Moderating the session, Manjari Chandra, Clinical Nutritional &amp; Founder, Manjari Wellness, said: “Research shows that certain plant foods contain powerful compounds — called phytochemicals — that can help fight cancer and reduce the risk of its development. ” She added that these specific foods may hold a key to prevent the growth of cancer cells in the body. During Covid times, the role of good nutrition has substantially increased as it helps boost immunity, which helps fight all types of diseases including cancer. This can also be corroborated by a research paper published in the Asia Pacific Journal of Cancer that stated the Covid-19 pandemic has taken a big toll on the clinical trials running for oncology, the study and treatment of tumours.

    "title": "AIIMS Researchers Sound Caution After Finding Zoonotic Malarial Parasite in Indian Patients",
    "body": "2020/09/08 - AIIMS researchers have sounded a note of caution after finding the presence of malarial parasite ‘Plasmodium knowlesi’ in the north Indian population, while doing a study on patients with Acute Febrile Illnesses (AFI) and pathogens causing them. The presence of the zoonotically transmitted malaria parasite was found during the study of Acute Febrile Iillnesses and causative pathogens in cerain patients admitted in AIIMS from July 2017 to September 2018. The All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) researchers from the Department of Biochemistry along with clinicians from the Department of Medicine were involved in the study on the pathogens causing severe fever. A zoonotic disease is a disease that can be spread/jump from animals to humans, and vice versa. It can be caused by viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi. It is necessary to understand how zoonotic diseases spread, and the way they infect humans, given the fact that the world is at present battling novel coronavirus that has emerged from bats. Plasmodium knowlesi is a malaria parasite found in nature in long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques. The team is led by Pragyan Acharya, Associate Professor, Department of Biochemistry, and comprises Manish Soneja from the Department of Medicine, along with Rajendra Mandage, Atreyi Pramanik, Parul Kodan, Vinod Sinha, Shivam Pandey and R. M. Pandey. “The major lesson from this study is that zoonotic parasites are all around us – therefore maintaining a clean environment and following specific guidelines for the prevention of these diseases are important,” Acharya told IANS. “A major reason for zoonotic pathogens’ effect on our lives is because we are encroaching the space of their animal hosts – massive decline in forest cover and consequent depleted habitats,” Acharya added. “However, this pathogen is not commonly tested during diagnosis, possibly due to its low prevalence and absence of rapid diagnostic methods. ” The researchers said that their study shows the presence of the zoonotic parasite in states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Delhi. An earlier study at AIIMS had shown its presence in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. According to the World Health Organisation, the parasite can give rise to daily fever spikes 9-12 days after the infection. Severe infection may lead to organ failure as well. Acharya and her team also found that simultaneous pathogenic infections in patients with fever can occur, influencing the severity of disease. The team found that malaria can exist with other co-infecting pathogens like dengue virus and bacterial species Leptospira and Orientia Tsutsugamushi. In tropical countries like India, acute febrile illnesses comprise a group of infections with similar clinical presentations such as fever, malaise, bodyache, chills, hepatic and renal dysfunction, and CNS effects. It is often difficult to distinguish between the causative agents of AFI, which can be bacterial, parasitic, or viral. Therefore, these pathogens may infect individuals at the same time and lead to modulation of immune responses, change treatment outcomes, and affect disease severity. The correct diagnosis of the infective agent causing fever is thus very important to ensure the right treatment. The study results ask us to be vigilant about the possibility of multiple pathogenic causes of fever, and to maintain the habitats and ecosystems of animals, the AIIMS researchers added. "

Watch Now Microsoft has decided to end Visual Studio Codespaces, the rebranded version of Visual Studio Online, and instead will merge it with GitHub’s take on the same product. Visual Studio Codespaces (formerly Visual Studio Online) is a cloud-based development environment aimed at making developers more more productive by creating a fully configured development environment in minutes. The announcement that Visual Studio Codespaces will be “consolidating” into GitHub Codespaces isn’t a surprise given the duplication between the two. SEE: Cheat sheet: Windows 10 PowerToys (free PDF) (TechRepublic) Microsoft announced the rebranded product in May at Build 2020 alongside the new GitHub Codespaces, which itself is a take on VS Codespaces. Both products are online companions to Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code (VS Code). According to Microsoft, the decision to move Visual Studio Codespaces to GitHub was to reduce confusion between the two near-identical products. “After the GitHub-native experience was released, we started hearing that the two distinct experiences were causing confusion amongst our users,” explains Allison Buchholtz-Au, a program manager for Visual Studio Online. “We believe that by consolidating the current Codespaces experiences into one, we can eliminate confusion, simplify the experience for everyone, and make more rapid progress to address customer feedback. ” The shift means Visual Studio Codespaces users will need to move to GitHub Codespaces by February 2021, when the Visual Studio Codespaces offering on Azure will end. What’s not clear yet is the pricing for GitHub Codespaces, which is currently in a private beta. In May, along with the rebrand from Visual Studio Online, Microsoft reduced the price of VS Codespaces in the Microsoft Azure cloud. Microsoft cut the prices of instances for Visual Studio Codespaces in Azure by more than half their previous prices. For example, the Basic tier with two cores and 4GB of RAM was reduced to to . 08 per hour, while the standard offer with four cores and 8GB of RAM on a Linux instance was reduced from about . 45 per hour to . 17 per hour. The premium tier with eight cores and 16GB of RAM was reduced from . 87 to . 34. Pricing for GitHub Codespaces hasn’t been finalized and there’s no mention of Azure on its website. Microsoft’s Buchholtz-Au notes that, from September 4, current Visual Studio Codespaces users can begin transitioning to the GutHub private beta. On November 20, Microsoft will prevent users from creating new plans and Visual Studio Codespaces, though existing ones will live on. At that point new users will only be able to sign up for Codespaces on GitHub. The final cut-off date comes on February 17, 2021, when Microsoft will shut the Visual Studio Codespaces portal and “all plans and codespaces remaining in the service will be deleted”. SEE: Seven Windows 10 annoyances (and how to fix them) As for pricing of GitHub Codespaces, Microsoft explains in an FAQ document that it will provide details later this year when GitHub Codespaces reaches general availability. “There is no charge for GitHub Codespaces while it is in limited public beta. Final pricing for GitHub Codespaces will be announced when Codespaces reaches general availability, which is expected later this year,” Microsoft states. “There is not a way to move Visual Studio Codespaces over to GitHub Codespaces. You will need to re-create your codespaces once you gain access to the GitHub Codespaces beta,” Microsoft notes. Hosting options are yet to be determined for developers who’ve used Visual Studio Codespaces with GitHub rivals like GitLab and BitBucket. “While GitHub Codespaces provides an optimized creation experience for GitHub repositories, we are currently iterating on the experience for repositories hosted elsewhere and will keep you updated as plans formalize,” Microsoft says.

You read that correctly. Not only can you brand yourself from head to toe in AMD gear, you can let everyone know you’re a part of the red team (or is it orange team, now?) with a new set of wheels. Available in the AMD fan shop to those in the US willing to pay a $50 shipping fee, there are two models to choose from: the AMD Custom Cruiser and the AMD Custom Mountain Bike. Both vehicles sport an 18. 5” frame and 26” aluminium wheels, but there are noticeable differences between them. Designed for the casual cyclist, AMD’s Cruiser is much simpler, forgoing gears and adding fenders to prevent dirt and muck from being thrown up. AMD’s Mountain Bike goes in the opposite direction, packing 21-gear Shimano index-shifting gears on a dual-suspension frame and linear brakes. And yet both cost the exact same amount at $299. Regardless of whether you choose a black frame with white wheels or a white frame with black wheels, you’ll be promoting AMD with a bold logo on the frame and Ryzen’s signature colour on the handlebars. If you truly want to show your dedication, though, you can always opt for the white frame with orange wheels, exclusive to the Mountain Bike. It’s not yet certain whether these bikes will see an international release, or just how serious AMD is about its travel products.

Similar was the case with the OnePlus 8 series and the same will happen with the OnePlus 8T series as well. Besides working on an affordable OnePlus phone dubbed Clover the company is also gearing up to bring OnePlus 8T. A report from Android Central reveals some details about the OnePlus 8T. The report reveals some of the key specifications of the upcoming OnePlus 8T and also when the phone will launch. Let’s take a look at everything that the report reveals about the upcoming OnePlus flagship smartphone. OnePlus 8T specifications (expected) According to the OnePlus 8T is codenamed Kebab. The report suggests that the OnePlus 8T will come with a 6. 55-inch AMOLED display similar to the OnePlus 8. The smartphone is tipped to come with a 120Hz screen refresh rate. The report suggests that the OnePlus 8T will feature two modes to choose from 60Hz and 120Hz. Sources close to the development revealed to the publication that the OnePlus 8T will pack four rear cameras at the back. The report suggests that the phone will include a 48MP primary image sensor, 16MP wide-angle module, 5MP macro, and 2MP portrait lens. This means that OnePlus will add an extra lens to the 8T when compared to the OnePlus 8. The OnePlus 8 features a triple rear camera setup including a 48MP primary sensor, secondary 16MP wide-angle, and third is a 2MP macro sensor. What is OnePlus Clover and everything we know so far The report further reveals that the OnePlus 8T will be powered by Qualcomm’s latest flagship processor Snapdragon 865+ processor paired with 8GB RAM with 128GB of internal storage. On the software front. the 8T is said to run OxygenOS 11 based on Android 11 out of the box. Earlier this week, alleged renders of the OnePlus 8T were revealed for the first time. The renders suggested that OnePlus will not bring a major change to the 8T when compared to the 7T launched last year. OnePlus 8T launch timeline According to the report, OnePlus 8T will launch by the end of September or the first week of October. At the same time, last year OnePlus announced the 7T. The smartphone manufacturer is yet to reveal details about the OnePlus 8T and also the official launch timeline. Meanwhile, the company is also working on an affordable smartphone dubbed OnePlus Clover. OnePlus recently launched the Nord, the first mid-range smartphone after the OnePlus One.

    "body": "2020/09/08 - Google Maps takes assistance from Deep Minds, a London-based AI lab owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet to get accurate results for users. Google, in a blog post, explains how the AI helps it collect data using neural networks to predict future traffic. This data includes live traffic information collected anonymously from Android devices, historical traffic data, information like speed limits and construction sites from local governments, and also factors like the quality, size, and direction of any given road, The Verge noted. “We then combine this database of historical traffic patterns with live traffic conditions, using machine learning to generate predictions based on both sets of data,” Johann Lau, product Manager Google Maps, wrote in the blog post. Other than the AI, Google relies on traffic data from authorities of local governments and real-time feedback from users. Google noted that its traffic predictions have been consistently accurate for over 97 per cent of trips. For the noted inaccuracy in Estimated Time Arrival (ETA), Google takes help of DeepMind using Graph Neural Networks that helps it in achieving accuracy. Google noted that it has seen improvements in Berlin, Jakarta, São Paulo, Sydney, Tokyo, and Washington DC. Through neural networks, Google Maps is able to better predict a journey well before it is even started. As per Google, the traffic patterns around the world have dramatically changed since the beginning of COVID 19 and so it will prioritise historical traffic patterns from the last two-to-four weeks, and deprioritise patterns from any time before that. In related news, Google Maps is testing a dark mode for the app. Until now, users were able to use the dark-mode in navigate option but as per a report by 9to5Google, Google may roll out an app-wide dark mode. However, it was just the APK versions that were uploaded by Google to the Play Store, meaning that they may or may not get materialised. The 10. 5. 0 version of Google Maps describes a new “Appearance” menu in Settings where users will have three options: Default to device theme, Dark theme, and Light theme. The report noted that creating a dark map is likely a big effort and not as simple as inverting colours. "

Moving to optics, not a lot is known but we can speculate it may have multiple camera lenses. The young brand is also teasing a big battery capacity, but this information is still under wraps. POCO M2 versus the competition The POCO M2, when launched, will look to take on the latest Redmi 9 Prime that comes with a Full HD+ display under Rs 10,000. Assuming the POCO phone is priced around Rs 10,000, other rivals may include the Realme C15 and Samsung Galaxy M01s. "

    "title": "Dell XPS 15 2020 review Window to ultimate luxury",
    "body": "2020/09/08 - Dell XPS 15 (2020) starts at Rs 1,90,495. 78. (Photo credit: Saurabh Singh/Financial Express) The XPS is widely regarded as Dell’s answer to the MacBook Pro. It is a line-up that Windows users look up to whenever they are looking to splurge on and expect the same level of finesse in craftsmanship and horsepower in performance. No other machine comes close. Though Dell keeps updating these machines with newer, faster processors and improved design from time to time, over the last few years, it has been criticised for not having updated the XPS 15 as much as the smaller – and relatively more mainstream — XPS 13. That changes with the XPS 15 in 2020. The XPS 15 in 2020 has a new design, new display, new hardware, and a new pricing and configuration strategy for India that reinstates the obvious – this is the window to the ultimate luxury. Design and build quality The XPS 15 is the best-looking laptop in the market today. Dell is using the same materials as last year; the only difference is that it is using them better. The lid and the bottom chassis are still made of high-quality metal. The keyboard deck is still made of aerospace-grade carbon fibre. But the edges now come with diamond cut finish and the hinge is so inconspicuous, the whole thing looks like it is one continuous slab of uninterrupted metal. The XPS 15 looks sharp and futuristic, the kind of laptop that will look good as much inside a boardroom, as it will outside on the coffee table. It is very well made – read, solid – too. The XPS 15 is the best-looking laptop in the market today. (Photo credit: Saurabh Singh/Financial Express) There is a catch though. At 2. 05kg, the XPS 15 is on the heavier side of things against a comparable 16-inch MacBook Pro, which makes its “edgy” design difficult to carry around, but that is a small price you pay for all that premium. For what it is worth, the XPS 15 is still one of the most compact 15. 6-inch laptops around. The XPS 15 looks sharp and futuristic. (Photo credit: Saurabh Singh/Financial Express) There are other big changes as well. For starters, the hallmark XPS edge-to-edge screen is truly edge-to-edge now. The chunky bottom bezel from last year is out of the window to entail an awe-inspiring 92. 9% screen-to-body ratio which is a 10% improvement from the previous model. Dell calls it a four-sided Infinity Edge display, and just maybe, this is one of those rare instances where a brand’s marketing mumbo jumbo means something. The display on the XPS 15 is one of its kind (more on that later). As is usually the case, Dell has both touchscreen and non-touchscreen options – the former also gets Corning Gorilla Glass 6 protection. Likewise, you can get the XPS 15 with FHD and UHD resolution. It is very well made – read, solid. (Photo credit: Saurabh Singh/Financial Express) The trackpad on the XPS 15 is 62% larger. The individual keys have been sized up too – these are now 9. 7% larger. The speaker grilles have been remapped and placed on either side of the keyboard à la the MacBook Pro. Lastly, this one also pulls the plug on legacy ports, instead giving you three USB Type-C ports. Interestingly, Dell has decided to retain a full-sized SD-card reader and audio jack, both of which are fast becoming a rarity in thin and light laptops. Display The display is the main reason why you would want to buy the XPS 15 and that is the main reason why you should buy it. No other laptop, including the MacBook Pro, offers as much per pixel quality as the XPS 15. Moreover, the size – which is 15. 6-inch – hits the sweet spot for most content creators. Dell also has a 17-inch model, that offers even more real estate just in case. The display is the main reason why you would want to buy the XPS 15. (Photo credit: Saurabh Singh/Financial Express) The XPS 15 is virtually all screen with up to 4K Ultra HD+ (this is what I have for review) resolution. The panel is LCD (and not OLED like last year) with 100% Adobe RGB, 94% DCIP 3 colour gamut, and Dolby Vision support. The aspect ratio also gets a refresh (speaking of which it is still a 60Hz panel) and it is 16:10 now which I personally think is better since it helps a great deal with productivity tasks and that is the kind of buyer the XPS 15 is intended for. The screen gets plenty bright, shows rich and vibrant colours, and viewing angles are great. Performance and battery life This is where things start to get interesting. In India, Dell is offering the XPS 15 in just two configurations. Both the configurations ship with a 10th Generation Intel Core i7-10750H (Comet Lake-H) processor. The i7-10750H is an 8 core, 16 thread processor built on a 14nm process node with a base clock speed of 2. 6GHz and boost speeds of up to 5GHz. The chip consumes 45W of TDP. Dell is offering the XPS 15 in just two configurations. (Photo credit: Saurabh Singh/Financial Express) Both the configurations also ship with the same Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 Ti which is a mid-range graphics card. This is paired with up to 32GB of DDR4-2933 RAM (dual channel), and 1TB PCIe NVMe M. 2 SSD. This is the top-of-the-line model and is priced in India at Rs 2,18,495. 78. The base configuration with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD, plus FHD non-touch screen display) comes in at Rs 1,90,495. 78. Single-core performance is good for a laptop of its class. Multithreaded performance is also mostly good which makes the XPS 15 an instant recommendation for content creators. Performance is at par – if not better – than an equivalently priced 16-inch MacBook Pro (that starts at Rs 1,99,900 for a model with 6-core Core i7. This is a laptop that you can also do some light gaming on, but it is not a gaming rig. There are dedicated machines for that (some of which are also cheaper). The XPS 15 tends to get hot at peak loads. (Photo credit: Saurabh Singh/Financial Express) While short-term performance has been good, I am more interested to see how this thing holds up in the long term though because there is (still) a big question mark on the thermals here. The XPS 15 tends to get hot at peak loads, which is during multi-tasking, and the dual fans get loud (and are distinctly audible which does not really bode well for such an expensive machine). The same question mark is carried forward to in battery life. Even though there is a sizeable 86Whr battery inside the XPS 15, the giant immersive screen and power-hungry processor mean, battery life leaves a lot to be desired. Depending on your mileage, you can get anywhere between 6-7 hours, which does not inspire a lot of confidence. The laptop supports fast charging through any of its three USB Type-C ports. A few quick pointers: The laptop supports fast charging through any of its three USB Type-C ports. (Photo credit: Saurabh Singh/Financial Express) The XPS 15 with its nice and tactile keys (1. 3mm of travel) and large trackpad (which is almost as big as the MacBook Pro’s) is an absolute joy to type on. The XPS 15 has a quad speaker setup consisting of two woofers on either side of the keyboard and two tweeters in the base. Together, the setup is capable of outputting 3D audio. They are quite good offering nice and full audio with minimal distortion at peak volume. Two of the three USB Type-C ports in the XPS 15 support Thunderbolt 3. The laptop also supports Killer Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5. 1. Dell bundles a USB-C to USB-A dongle in the box. The laptop has sensors in the lid to automatically detect and boot up the system when you open it. There is also a physical fingerprint reader. Should you buy the Dell XPS 15 (2020)? The XPS is widely regarded as Dell’s answer to the MacBook Pro. (Photo credit: Saurabh Singh/Financial Express) The XPS enjoys its own select clientele and then there are those who fancy it. For the former, I am happy to report that the XPS 15 is the most luxurious XPS that Dell has ever made. For the latter, I am afraid its high asking price and lack of lower configurations means, it is still hard to reach for many. But that is how the XPS has always been. You may not necessarily need it, but chances are you would still want it, because well, just look at it. Who would not want it? As for getting things done, I suggest you bump up your budget (if you can afford it) and try and go for the XPS 17 if you are serious about content creation. Even though the MacBook Pro offers more bang for your buck, the XPS 15 (or 17) is the only thing that comes close on the Windows side. It could have done with better thermals (and battery life) but there are also areas where it even trumps Apple’s latest and greatest. For a product like the XPS 15 that represents the bleeding edge of technology, it is alright that it is not perfect. Only then we can hope that the next iteration will be even better. Pros: Luxurious design Immersive display Excellent keyboard and trackpad Loud speakers Cons: Thermals need work Battery life could be better Pricey Also Read HP Pavilion Gaming 16 review: Challenging the status quo "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - The ban on PUBG in India has led to a rise in popularity of other gaming apps such as Garena Free Fire, Ludo King and Call of Duty, making them top gainers in terms of download after the government announced the ban on September 2. Data from Sensor Tower shows that Garena Free Fire, Ludo King and Call of Duty are the top three downloaded games across iOS and Android app stores between September 2 to September 5. While Garena recorded 2. 1 million downloads in the four-day period from India, homegrown gaming app Ludo King registered 1. 52 million downloads. Notably, Call of Duty received 1. 56 million downloads in the past 30 days of which 1. 15 million downloads came in just those four days. Data also showed that the three apps are leading the Google Play Store’s top chart for gaming categories in India since September 2. On Apple’s App Store, Call of Duty is at the top. Garena Free Fire was developed by Singapore-based Sea Ltd and Call of Duty by the American tech company Activision Blizzard. Tencent used to hold a 5% stake in Activision through its subsidiary TiMi Studios. However, Activision had recently parted ways with Tencent and TiMi. On September 2, the Indian government had banned 118 Chinese origin apps, including PUBG. The move has received a mixed response from the esports industry. Some companies said that the decision would impact organisers and broadcasters in India while a section of the industry favoured the move saying it would help the homegrown players. Soon after the ban, Indian gaming company nCore has announced a PUBG-like gaming app called FAU-G which is slated to launch in October. While the newly announced app has managed to make some buzz on social media, it would be interesting to watch how it lives up to expectations of gaming enthusiasts. "

    "title": "We asked you told us Samsung s new update policy would make you buy its phones",
    "body": "2020/09/08 - Samsung made waves roughly a month ago when it announced that it would offer three years of Android version updates to a variety of its devices. The Korean brand says it’ll offer three years of major version updates to the Galaxy S10 and up, the Galaxy Note 10 and higher, and several more devices. In fact, even the budget-focused Galaxy A series is getting in on the update action too, down to the mid-range Galaxy A51. So it got us wondering whether this pledge alone would be enough for customers to actually want to buy Samsung phones. Results The poll was published on August 22, drawing in 6,730 votes. And the results are overwhelmingly positive for the Korean brand. Almost 94% of readers said they’d buy a Samsung device due to this new approach to updates. Just over 6% of people voted in the negative, saying they don’t care about the new policy. We can’t say we’re surprised by this result at all, as a previous Android Authority poll found that roughly 96% of respondents wanted Android updates for three to five years. Furthermore, another Android Authority poll found that ~85% of readers wouldn’t consider a phone if it didn’t get a single major Android update. Related: Android 10 rollout — Which brand was fastest? It’s clear then that Android version updates are extremely important to our readers, as you’d expect. But will this update policy result in increased sales for Samsung? We’ll just have to wait and see. Your comments daftrok : It is a step in the right direction but to me security updates are more important than OS updates. 3 years OS and 4-5 years security would be ideal. Adrian Bönde: 3 years is not solving any issue. . it should be much longer. Apple has 5 years which should be the minimum for every smartphone! The hardware is capable of bringing more years of compatibility with the newest software releases and at these smartphone prices the companies should show responsibility by letting these phones live as long as possible! Jeshurun Kandy: I don’t really care about is updates from the manufacturer all that much as I’d much rather flash a custom ROM, with basically eternal updates especially for popular devices. – from my Galaxy Note 3 running Android 10 anonymous 42: This is great, i was already considering saving up and buying the Samsung A51 because it’s a great phone. And it’s good to know if i do get the phone, i would not only be getting a phone that’s have Android 10 and still getting Android updates but 3 of them. That’s mean i can get Android 13 when it’s comes, that’s more than even flagships. Another reason for me to try and save up for the A51. MM_Rafez : I would trade off 1 android version update with 2 years of additional security updates. D9: Good on Samsung. I can keep one of their phones for a couple of years and then pass it on to a relative or friend with some life left in it as far as software support goes.

A handful of other devices have followed suit, including the Galaxy Note 10 Lite which also received One UI 2. 5.

The rollout process is gradual but it will eventually reach every one of the millions of Galaxy Note 8 units that have been sold by Samsung over the years. The latest update for the Galaxy Note 8 can be identified by firmware version N950FXXUDDTH1 and, as expected, it doesn’t seem to bring any new features to the aging S Pen device. In addition, Samsung has yet to detail the September 2020 security patch so it’s unclear what vulnerabilities it’s supposed to fix. Regardless, higher security is always welcomed and you should update your Galaxy Note 8 as soon as you have the opportunity to do so. If you reside in Nordic countries, you can try to trigger the update process by opening Settings on your phone, accessing Software update, and tapping Download and install. If you reside elsewhere, keep an eye out for new update notifications on your phone.

    "body": "2020/09/08 - It has long been rumored that Microsoft is working on two Xbox consoles for next-gen, aiming to claim both ends of the market. And now, we can confirm indeed that the pricing scheme should be very familiar, matching that of the Xbox One X and Xbox One S of yesteryear. We can confirm via our sources that the entry-level Xbox Series S will cost $299 at retail, with a $25 per month Xbox All Access financing option, which Microsoft is planning to push hard via various retailers and a large global rollout. The more powerful Xbox Series X will cost $499, with a $35 per month Xbox All Access financing option. Both consoles will launch on November 10, 2020. The Xbox Series S just leaked (via Brad Sams), giving us a glimpse at Microsoft’s entry-level next-gen SKU. The Xbox Series S is small enough to fit inside an Xbox Series X, and we expect it to be around 4TF RDNA2, making it roughly around as powerful as the Xbox One X, perhaps geared towards 1080p monitors with better frame rates. We don’t have further details on the console’s capabilities beyond that, but we expect NVME drives, and many of the newer “next-gen” features like fast resuming multiple games, and ray tracing. The Xbox Series X is a 12TF beast of a console that will boast 4K resolution and 60 FPS as standard, with some games, like Halo Infinite, going all the way up to 120 FPS in multiplayer. The prices Microsoft have put forward for the Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X put them firmly in-line with the Xbox One S and Xbox One X, and it will be interesting to see how Sony prices the competing PlayStation 5 in response. Microsoft will push Xbox All Access financing far more broadly than it did this gen, which was seen as a bit of a pilot program. We’re expecting Xbox All Access to roll out to far more markets than it did previously, and we also expect the Xbox Series consoles to gun for a global simultaneous launch in all existing Xbox markets, rather than the slow rollout we saw for the Xbox One in 2013.

This device has been leaking quite a lot recently, and today from Korea comes a new video, this time showing its swiveling display in motion, being rotated and whatnot. See for yourself: The T shape is definitely unconventional, as is this handset’s entire form factor. In a sea of similar looking glass slabs (and some foldable screen devices), this design is definitely fresh. What remains to be seen is how many people are going to be willing to pay around $1,000 for the Wing, especially considering it’s been rumored to forego a flagship chipset. The use cases this form factor enables are intriguing, but we’re left wondering how many third party apps are ever going to fully support the unique dual display solution at work here. On the plus side, the phone doesn’t look like it’s horribly thick in this video, so there’s that. Stay tuned for more leaks on the Wing as they appear, and hang around for the official announcement next Monday. Via "

Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Huawei plans to sell the phone in many places outside the Middle East and Central and Pacific Asia. Back when images of the Mate 30 series first started making their way online, it seemed like Huawei planned to release a Lite variant of the phone. Huawei never ended up announcing that device, but the company just revealed what is effectively a Mate 30 Lite by another name. The only problem is you’ll have trouble getting ahold of the Huawei Y9a if you live outside of the handful of markets where the company plans to sell the device. So far, we’ve only seen that it’s coming to Iraq where it will cost $239. Limited availability aside, the Y9a looks like it could be a decent mid-range option. The phone features a MediaTek Helio G80 processor and a 6. 63-inch LCD display with 2,400 x 1,080 resolution. The highlight of the Y9a is a 16MP pop-up selfie camera that helps give the phone a 92% screen-to-body ratio. For all other photos, there’s a 64MP primary camera complimented by a 2MP depth sensor and 8MP ultrawide and 2MP macro cameras. Related: The best Huawei phones you can buy right now In Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and some countries in Central Asia, the company will sell a model of the Y9a that features 8GB of RAM, a 4,200mAh battery, and 40W fast charging support. Outside of those markets, the Y9a will feature 6GB of RAM and a 4,300mAh with 22. 5W charging support. According to Huawei, the 40W adapter can charge the Y9a to 70% battery in approximately 30 minutes. Both variants will feature 128GB of expandable storage with Huawei’s EMUI 10. 1 coming preinstalled on the phone. Like most of Huawei’s recent phones, the Y9a won’t come with Google Play, forcing those who buy the phone to get their apps from Huawei’s AppGallery store. Rounding out the Y9a feature list is a side-mounted fingerprint sensor and a 3. 5mm headphone jack. At launch, Huawei plans to sell the phone in three colors: Space Silver, Sakura Pink, and Midnight Black. If Huawei decides to release the Y9a in more markets, we’ll let you know. "

The Roman Space Telescope, named after the space pioneer and “mother of Hubble,” Nancy Grace Roman, will investigate distant facets of the universe including seeking to understand dark energy and searching for exoplanets. It will also look for wandering rogue planets, which could be far more abundant in our galaxy than previously thought. To look at into the depths of space, Roman needs a large primary mirror 2. 4 meters across which will allow it to capture a field of view 100 times that of Hubble. That primary mirror has now been completed and polished so finely that the average of the bumps on its surface is just 1. 2 nanometers tall. “Achieving this milestone is very exciting,” Scott Smith, Roman telescope manager at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, said in a statement. “Success relies on a team with each person doing their part, and it’s especially true in our current challenging environment. Everyone plays a role in collecting that first image and answering inspiring questions. ” The mirror is a key part of a telescope as it directs light to science instruments such as Roman’s Wide Field Instrument, essentially a giant camera, and the Coronagraph Instrument, which can spot distant planets by blocking out the glare from nearby stars. To make sure the data is as accurate as possible, the mirror needs to have a near-perfect finish. The mirror also needs to withstand the stresses of launch and the space environment, so it is made of special low-expansion glass which doesn’t expand and contract with temperature changes. By reducing the expansion and flex of the mirror, the telescope will be able to pick out more accurate details. The mirror has been extensively tested alone, and the next step is for the mirror to be tested while mounted in its support structure. “Roman’s primary mirror is complete, yet our work isn’t over,” said Smith. “We’re excited to see this mission through to launch and beyond, and eager to witness the wonders it will reveal. ” Editors’ Recommendations "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - A new research finding on radiation will support the UAE’s ambitious project to build the first human settlement on Mars by 2117, a scientist has revealed. “Radiation is one of the biggest roadblocks in planning long-term space missions, especially the project to establish a human presence on Mars [UAE’s Mars 2117 project],” said Dr Dimitra Atri, Research Scientist at Centre for Space Science in the New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD). In an interview with state news agency WAM, he said he has made important findings from his research on the impact of radiation on astronaut health in long-term space missions. His team has been able to calculate the amount of radiation dose deposited in different organs of the human body from astrophysical sources very precisely. “We found that radiation exposure to astronauts is comparable to the dose that cancer patients receive during radiation treatment,” he told WAM. “By comparing our calculations with radiation therapy data we have been able to estimate health risks to astronauts from background radiation in space,” Atri said. “Equipped with this knowledge, we will be in a better position to develop technologies to mitigate the impact of radiation and help with UAE’s efforts to establish a human base on Mars. We will be publishing our findings very shortly and share our results with the scientific community in the UAE and abroad,” he explained. The UAE’s Mars 2117 project includes putting in place a programme to prepare Emiratis for Mars and space exploration. The project aims to build the first city on Mars in 100 years. The project will be associated with research themes involved in the exploration of faster transportation systems to Mars, as well as building houses and producing energy and food. It will also try to find faster transportation methods for travelling to and from Mars. Previously, a senior scientist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), said that the UAE’s plan to build the first human settlement on Mars by 2117 would be possible. “I think we’ll get there,” said Dr Lori Glaze, planetary science division director at NASA, adding: “I would say that having multiple countries now [on Mars exploration] has increased our capability [globally] of going back and forth to Mars. ” Atri said that a planned space biology laboratory at the Centre for Space Science at NYUAD will support the UAE’s research aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The UAE has a prominent human spaceflight programme and its next step is to carry out scientific experiments on board the International Space Station, he added. The NYUAD Centre will also use data from Hope Probe, the UAE’s historic mission to Mars, he said. “We will combine data from Hope Probe with NASA’s Curiosity rover data, which is based at the Gale crater on Mars to understand how radiation propagates all the way down to the surface of the planet. This will help us better understand the radiation environment on the surface of Mars in case of extreme events which will be very useful in planning human missions on Mars,” Atri added. "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - Credit: CC0 Public Domain Herring gulls notice where approaching humans are looking, and flee sooner when they’re being watched, a new study shows. Researchers approached gulls while either looking at the ground or directly at the birds. Gulls were slower to move away when not being watched—allowing a human to get two metres closer on average. Newly fledged gulls were just as likely to react to human gaze direction as older birds, suggesting they are born with this tendency or quickly learn it. The study, by the University of Exeter, also confirms the widely held view that urban gulls are bolder than rural gulls—letting a person get on average 2. 5m closer before walking or flying away. “Herring gulls are increasingly breeding and foraging in urban areas, and therefore have regular interactions with humans,” said lead author Madeleine Goumas, of the Centre for Ecology and Conservation at Exeter’s Penryn Campus in Cornwall. “We know from previous research that gulls are less likely to peck a bag of chips if a human is watching—but in that experiment the researcher either looked at the gulls or turned their head away. “In our new study, the experimenter approached while facing the gull and only changed the direction of their eyes—either looking down or at the gull. “We were interested to find that gulls pay attention to human eye direction specifically, and that this is true for juveniles as well as adults—so their aversion to human gaze isn’t a result of months or years of negative interactions with people. ” The study was conducted in Cornwall, UK, targeting adult gulls (aged four years or older, evidenced by white and grey plumage) and juveniles (born in the year of the study, with completely brown plumage). A total of 155 gulls were included in the findings: 50 adults and 45 juveniles in urban settlements, and 34 adults and 26 juveniles in rural settlements. As well as being quicker to flee, rural gulls were also more than three times as likely to fly—rather than walk—away from an approaching human, suggesting they are less used to being approached. “The growing number of herring gulls in urban areas may make them appear more common than they really are,” Goumas said. “The species is actually in decline in the UK, and we hope our ongoing research into human-gull interactions will contribute to conservation efforts. ” The paper, published in the journal Animal Behaviour, is titled “Herring gull aversion to gaze in urban and rural human settlements. ” Explore further Staring at seagulls could save your chips More information: Madeleine Goumas et al.

Using various space observatories, astronomers have conducted multi-wavelength study of a high-magnetic-field pulsar known as PSR J1119−6127, which underwent an outburst in 2016. The results shed more light on the properties of this pulsar during the post-outburst period. The study is detailed in a paper published August 28 on arXiv. org. Pulsars are highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars emitting a beam of electromagnetic radiation. They are usually detected in the form of short bursts of radio emission, however, some of them are also observed using optical, X-ray and gamma-ray telescopes. PSR J1119−6127 was discovered in 2000 by the Parkes multibeam pulsar survey, likely associated with the supernova remnant G292. 2-0. 5 at a distance of about 27,400 light years. The pulsar has a spin period of 0. 407 seconds, a characteristic age of some 1,600 years and spin-down power of approximately 2. 3 undecillion erg/s. In late July 2016, NASA’s Fermi and Swift spacecraft detected magnetar-like X-ray outbursts of PSR J1119−6127 and also 13 short X-ray bursts. The total energy that was released during this event was estimated to be at a level of around 1. 0 tredecillion erg. To better understand the evolution of PSR J1119−6127 after the 2016 outburst, several teams of researchers started to monitor this pulsar. One such team, led by Huihui Wang of the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, carried out a multi-wavelength (from radio to gamma-ray band) study of PSR J1119−6127. For this purpose, they used data from Fermi, Swift, ESA’s X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission (XMM-Newton) and NASA’s Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). “In this study, we have performed a multi-wavelength study for PSR J1119−6127 after its 2016 magnetar-like outburst,” the astronomers wrote in the paper. Before the 2016 outburst, the X-ray pulse peak of PSR J1119−6127 was aligned with its radio pulse peak. The study found no substantial shift between these peaks after the outburst. It was noted that the observed X-ray spectra of both on-pulse and off-pulse phases are well described by two blackbody components plus a power-law model. In general, the radio and X-ray emission properties, as well as the spindown properties of PSR J1119−6127 after the 2016 outburst were found to be similar to those of the magnetar XTE J1810−197, which underwent an X-ray outburst in 2003. Wang’s study revealed that the evolution of the timing solution, radio emission and X-ray emission properties of PSR J1119−6127 after its latest outburst are very similar to those of XTE J1810−197. However, the recovery time scale and released total energy are one or two orders of magnitude smaller in PSR J1119−6127. When it comes to the GeV gamma-ray emission from PSR J1119−6127, the results indicate that it is slightly suppressed around the 2016 outburst. The GeV spectral characteristics after January 2017 (post-relaxation epoch) are consistent with that of the pre-outburst period. Moreover, the phase difference between the gamma-ray peak and radio peak in the post-relaxation stage is about 0. 4, which is consistent with the measurement before the 2016 X-ray outburst. Taking into account all the collected data, the astronomers concluded that the 2016 X-ray outburst probably caused a reconfiguration of the global magnetosphere of PSR J1119−6127and changed the structure of the open field line regions. They added that this reconfiguration continued for about a half-year after the outburst.

    "body": "2020/09/08 - Credit: CC0 Public Domain Extreme weather and climate events causing extensive damage are a fact of the Canadian climate, and this year is no exception. On June 13, a mammoth hailstorm pounded Calgary with damage in excess of $1 billion dollars, the most expensive hailstorm in Canadian history. In early July, eastern Canada was subjected to both persistent extreme heat coupled with high humidity and major flooding. As we cope with these events, questions invariably arise about what role climate change may have played. Has a particular extreme been made worse because of our changing climate? How will these extremes change in the future? Water cycle accelerating Many of these questions are linked with the hydrologic cycle—the evaporation of water from the Earth’s surface and its vegetation, the transport of water vapor in the atmosphere from one place to another and the ultimate return of the water to the surface as precipitation. The water cycle speeds up when the climate warms. A warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor, creating the potential for more intense precipitation events. The evidence that human activity has warmed the global climate over the past century is incontrovertible. Satellite data available since 1988 indicate that the atmosphere has moistened, and that this is primarily due to the human-induced warming of the climate. Individual extreme events are, however, influenced by many other factors. A storm can leave behind moisture at the surface that can re-evaporate and strengthen subsequent events. The collision between a cold front and a lake breeze can lead to heavy precipitation. A delayed lake freeze-up during a warm winter can enhance lake-effect snowfall. Or a drought could limit local evapo-transpiration—evaporation from the land surface and transpiration from plants—eliminating the rainfall that comes from local moisture recycling and further intensifying hot, dry conditions. Heavy rainfall Many studies have examined precipitation-related change, usually focusing on average conditions rather than extremes. This is understandable because individual events, like a tornado or hail storm, are complex, and sparse ground observations and evolving techniques mean there aren’t yet long-term records that allow scientists to reliably estimate trends. In contrast, numerous rainfall records beginning in the 1950s or earlier exist across the globe. Statistical analyzes of data from these rain gages confirm that rainfall extremes have grown more intense at the global and continental levels, in agreement with climate models. There are broad indications that these changes in rainfall extremes are due to human influence on the climate at global and continental scales. Extreme one-day rainfall events that occurred about once every 20 years in the past are now occurring about once every 15 years. Even so, scientists still struggle to confidently say that a particular extreme rainfall event is the result of climate change. This is because there is naturally a large amount of variation in precipitation in one place, and the signal from climate change can get hidden within the natural noise. Future extremes Not all places have seen one-day rainfall extremes grow more intense over the past several decades, but that doesn’t mean it won’t happen in the future. The science indicates, with considerable confidence, that as the climate continues to warm, precipitation extremes will become substantially more intense in the mid-latitudes and northern land areas, including Canada. Although details are uncertain, heavy snowfall, freezing rain and hail will all change with continued warming. For example, a recent study suggests that large hail could become more likely in Alberta by mid-century, but less likely in some other parts of Canada. There is no doubt that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions have changed the climate. Nevertheless, the human imprint is often difficult to see in local meteorological observations. Despite that lack of direct “in your backyard” evidence, we should prepare for a future in which many precipitation-related extremes will become more intense.

    "title": "When antibodies mislead the quest for validation",
    "body": "2020/09/08 - Research antibodies are designed to recognize and bind to specific proteins according to their shape and chemical properties. Credit: Adapted from Molekuul/SPL Commercial antibodies are commonplace in biology laboratories. Researchers use these giant Y-shaped proteins to detect specific molecules in cells, tissues and test tubes. But sometimes the proteins detect other molecules, too — or even instead. When that happens, confusion can snowball. Consider the gene CR9ORF72. It’s often mutated in people with the neurodegenerative diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and familial frontotemporal dementia. But what it actually does has been hard to pin down, partly because the widely varying locations of the protein in the cell offer more confusion than clarity. Peter McPherson, a neuroscientist at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, suspects that the multiple locations arise from what is often seen as a trivial decision for detecting the protein: the choice of antibody. Antibodies work by binding to specific parts of a protein, according to the protein’s shape and chemical properties, but an antibody produced to bind to one protein can often bind to another, and sometimes with better affinity. That’s borne out in McPherson’s work. He and his team bought 16 antibodies marketed to detect CR9ORF72. Then they took a cell line that produces the protein at high levels and used the genome-editing tool CRISPR–Cas9 to make a line in which CR9ORF72 was knocked out, so the protein would not be present. They then assessed how the antibodies performed in the two lines in a series of common tests and found that the antibody that had been used in the most publications (and cited most often) found the protein even when it wasn’t there. Those that worked best for each assay had not appeared in the literature at all1. Others have reported comparable experiences. Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, tested 13 antibodies to try to untangle conflicting data about estrogen receptor β, a protein discovered in 1996 that is a potential anticancer target. Twelve of the antibodies, including the two most popular, gave either false positives or false negatives, or both, she and her team reported2. “Don’t take either the literature or the antibody for granted,” she warns. Antibody anarchy: a call to order Researchers often buy antibodies according to the number of times the product has been cited in the literature, but that strategy can overlook newer products that have been put through more rigorous tests. They also tend to assume that others who used the antibody before them checked that it worked as intended, and that it will therefore work in their own experiments, opening the door for self-perpetuating artefacts. “When I look at papers in general, I get depressed by the quality of the antibody characterization,” says Simon Goodman, a science consultant at the Antibody Society, a not-for-profit professional association. Goodman is based in Darmstadt, Germany, and has organized a series of educational webinars on appropriate techniques for the society3. “If you ask ‘how did you validate the antibody?’, researchers will say, ‘well we bought it and the producer says that it behaves like this. ’” Often, the data that companies provide to show an antibody works come from a cell line that has been engineered to express the protein at levels substantially higher than under physiological conditions. Researchers would do better to check that an antibody can detect the protein at physiological levels, in the technique and tissue type they plan to use and, ideally, that the signal fades or disappears when levels of the protein do. Validation drive There has been a steady drumbeat of efforts to make researchers more careful. In 2016, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) began requiring grant applicants to describe how they would authenticate antibodies and other key resources. Validation road maps have been printed, summits held and web portals established — Antibodypedia, Antibodies-online, Antibody Resource, Biocompare, CiteAb and Labome, to name a few. “The true game-changer has been CRISPR,” says Aled Edwards, who leads the Structural Genomics Consortium from Toronto, Canada, a public–private partnership devoted to doing basic science that can promote drug discovery. That’s because the technique makes it easy to perform useful control experiments, just as McPherson and his team did. Earlier this year, the antibody vendor Abcam in Cambridge, UK, introduced a suite of knockout cell lines and preparations that researchers can buy alongside its antibodies to test positive and negative cells under specific conditions in their own labs. The company now has more than 1,600 cell lines and 2,400 cell lysates available. An antibody signal in wild-type cells (top) should disappear in tissue in which the target protein has been knocked out (bottom). Credit: K. J. Rhodes and J. S. Trimmer/J. Neurosci. (2006, Society for Neuroscience) Edwards and McPherson helped to set up a Toronto-based charity called YCharOS (pronounced Ikaros), to put commercial antibodies to the test. They plan to use McPherson’s strategy to assess more antibodies against other targets, gauging performance across three common assays: immunoblot, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. They are also working with several antibody suppliers and pharmaceutical companies to develop standard operating protocols. As well as some in-kind corporate contributions, the NIH and the Parkinson’s disease charity the Michael J. Fox Foundation in New York City are providing initial funding of about US$300,000 to test a suite of antibodies used in neuroscience. Not every antibody can be tested using knockout controls, Edwards admits. About 10% of genes are essential to life, so a knockout cell line is not viable for them. Also, an antibody that performs well in one cell line could fall short in another. Still, these simple experiments can help to identify those antibodies that aren’t binding with their target protein. There are other methods researchers can try, too, such as coupling immunoprecipitation to mass spectrometry to see what proteins the antibody binds to4. Ultimately, says Edwards, “the onus is on the experimenter”. That said, it takes more than just the right antibody to yield informative experiments, says James Trimmer, who directs the NeuroMab lab at the University of California, Davis, an effort to produce high-quality antibodies for neuroscience. An antibody that works reliably when a protein is in its folded (‘native’) state inside a cell can perform differently when proteins are chemically altered in preserved tissue or unfolded in cell mixtures, and even small changes in sample preparation can have a large impact. Researchers need to know how their own methods compare with those used in validation experiments, and should avoid antibodies if the validation details are unavailable. “If you use them for the wrong purpose, they won’t be a good fit,” Trimmer says. Reproducibility crisis: Blame it on the antibodies It is not uncommon for labs to buy several antibodies and select the one that works best. But many developers license their antibodies to multiple distributors, who do not always disclose the antibodies’ origins. When setting out to test antibodies for C9ORF72, McPherson’s postdoc Carl Laflamme used CiteAb and the research literature to identify more than 100 antibody products. He then sent enquiries to vendors and scoured data sheets to rule out duplicates. Even so, the team realized later that 2 of the 16 antibodies they purchased from different companies were the same, so they had run a whole set of experiments unnecessarily. “We wasted our money and our time and effort,” McPherson says. Identity crisis Sometimes it’s not even clear which antibody researchers have used, especially in older studies. Only about 11% of the antibodies used in papers published in 1997 are identifiable, according to an analysis5 led by researchers at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), and the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in La Jolla, California; nowadays, that figure has risen to 43%. NatureTech hub Anita Bandrowski, head of SciCrunch and a bioinformatician at UCSD, is spearheading an effort to assign every antibody a unique identifier, called an RRID, and include it in publications. Researchers can find or request an RRID on the Antibody Registry’s website, and the identifiers would remain the same even if the vendor supplying an antibody changes its catalogue or goes out of business. Antibodies are much easier to find when journals mandate RRIDs, says Bandrowski. The journal Cell, for instance, asks authors for RRIDs, and 97% of its antibodies are findable5. Both Nature and Nature Research journals encourage the use of RRIDs to track key biological resources, including antibodies, cell lines, model organisms and tools. RRIDs can alleviate, but not solve, the problem of the same antibody being sold by many vendors: if the original source is clearly disclosed, all the antibodies can be assigned the same RRID. Bandrowski guesstimates that the 2. 5 million antibodies with RRIDs represent perhaps 700,000 unique molecules. But RRIDs do not distinguish between different batches of the same product, which can be particularly problematic for polyclonal antibodies, which are purified from the blood of immunized animals and are therefore more of a mixture than those made from cultured cells. The bottom line is: however an antibody-driven experiment comes out, researchers would be wise to be sceptical. When experiments fail, researchers often question their own technique, says Goodman. “Of course you blame yourself as a young scientist. ” But the scientific community should be equally sceptical of antibodies that seem to work, says Edwards, and demand evidence that they do before relying on them. “We buy antibodies, we don’t test them, and then we publish articles that send the field sideways. ” "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - Credit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain When historian Frederick Jackson Turner presented his famous thesis on the US frontier in 1893, he described the “coarseness and strength combined with acuteness and acquisitiveness” it had forged in the American character. Now, well into the 21st century, researchers led by the University of Cambridge have detected remnants of the pioneer personality in US populations of once inhospitable mountainous territory, particularly in the Midwest. A team of scientists algorithmically investigated how landscape shapes psychology. They analyzed links between the anonymised results of an online personality test completed by over 3. 3 million Americans, and the “topography” of 37,227 US postal—or ZIP—codes. The researchers found that living at both a higher altitude and an elevation relative to the surrounding region—indicating “hilliness”—is associated with a distinct blend of personality traits that fits with “frontier settlement theory”. “The harsh and remote environment of mountainous frontier regions historically attracted nonconformist settlers strongly motivated by a sense of freedom,” said researcher Friedrich Götz, from Cambridge’s Department of Psychology. “Such rugged terrain likely favored those who closely guarded their resources and distrusted strangers, as well as those who engaged in risky explorations to secure food and territory. ” “These traits may have distilled over time into an individualism characterized by toughness and self-reliance that lies at the heart of the American frontier ethos” said Götz, lead author of the study. “When we look at personality across the whole United States, we find that mountainous residents are more likely to have psychological characteristics indicative of this frontier mentality. ” Götz worked with colleagues from the Karl Landsteiner University of Health Sciences, Austria, the University of Texas, US, the University of Melbourne in Australia, and his Cambridge supervisor Dr. Jason Rentfrow. The findings are published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour. The research uses the “Big Five” personality model, standard in social psychology, with simple online tests providing high-to-low scores for five fundamental personality traits of millions of Americans. The mix of characteristics uncovered by study’s authors consists of low levels of “agreeableness”, suggesting mountainous residents are less trusting and forgiving—traits that benefit “territorial, self-focused survival strategies”. Low levels of “extraversion” reflect the introverted self-reliance required to thrive in secluded areas, and a low level of “conscientiousness” lends itself to rebelliousness and indifference to rules, say researchers. “Neuroticism” is also lower, suggesting an emotional stability and assertiveness suited to frontier living. However, “openness to experience” is much higher, and the most pronounced personality trait in mountain dwellers. “Openness is a strong predictor of residential mobility,” said Götz. “A willingness to move your life in pursuit of goals such as economic affluence and personal freedom drove many original North American frontier settlers. ” “Taken together, this psychological fingerprint for mountainous areas may be an echo of the personality types that sought new lives in unknown territories. ” The researchers wanted to distinguish between the direct effects of physical environment and the “sociocultural influence” of growing up where frontier values and identities still hold sway. To do this, they looked at whether mountainous personality patterns applied to people born and raised in these regions that had since moved away. The findings suggest some “initial enculturation” say researchers, as those who left their early mountain home are still consistently less agreeable, conscientious and extravert, although no such effects were observed for neuroticism and openness. The scientists also divided the country at the edge of St. Louis—”gateway to the West”—to see if there is a personality difference between those in mountains that made up the historic frontier, such as the Rockies, and eastern ranges e. g. the Appalachians. While mountains continue to be a “meaningful predictor” of personality type on both sides of this divide, key differences emerged. Those in the east are more agreeable and outgoing, while western ranges are a closer fit for frontier settlement theory. In fact, the mountainous effect on high levels of “openness to experience” is ten times as strong in residents of the old western frontier as in those of the eastern ranges. The findings suggest that, while ecological effects are important, it is the lingering sociocultural effects—the stories, attitudes and education—in the former “Wild West” that are most powerful in shaping mountainous personality, according to scientists. They describe the effect of mountain areas on personality as “small but robust”, but argue that complex psychological phenomena are influenced by many hundreds of factors, so small effects are to be expected. “Small effects can make a big difference at scale,” said Götz. “An increase of one standard deviation in mountainousness is associated with a change of around 1% in personality. ” “Over hundreds of thousands of people, such an increase would translate into highly consequential political, economic, social and health outcomes. ” "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - NASA is reaching out to university students to help solve the problem of lunar dust as the agency plans for sustainable human exploration of the Moon under the Artemis program. Lunar dust is mostly made of small particles that stick to just about everything. It’s abrasive and can damage things, including spacesuits, equipment, spacecraft, and habitats. Dust can obscure camera lenses, reduce technology performance, distort instrument readings, alter thermal properties, and even cause equipment failures. Additionally, if dust gets into habitats, glass-like dust particles can lodge in astronauts’ lungs, creating health risks. Removing lunar dust from where it’s not supposed to be – or stopping it from getting there in the first place – is essential for future space exploration. Through its annual Breakthrough, Innovative and Game-changing (BIG) Idea Challenge, NASA is looking for a wide range of creative solutions from college and university students on the theme of lunar dust mitigation. Categories under the theme include dust prevention and mitigation during landings, spacesuit dust tolerance, exterior dust clean up, and controlling lunar dust within habitats. Competition judges will select between five and 10 teams to receive up to $180,000 each to build, test, and demonstrate robust lunar dust mitigation, or dust tolerant capabilities and technologies. “This competition gives students an unparalleled opportunity as members of the Artemis generation to help overcome the historically challenging technical obstacles of mitigating lunar dust,” said Niki Werkheiser, NASA’s Game Changing Development program executive within the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD). “Proving a readiness to provide meaningful technical solutions to support near-term lunar missions is key, because NASA may be interested in including all or part of viable concepts into a future space mission. ” The 2021 BIG Idea Challenge is open to teams of between five and 25 undergraduate and graduate students from accredited U. S. -based colleges and universities affiliated with their state’s Space Grant Consortium or partnered with an affiliated school, including Minority Serving Institutions. Teams are also encouraged to collaborate with industry partners. “We know our nation’s colleges and universities provide a reservoir of student talent and creativity that brings new perspectives and solutions to NASA,” said Mike Kincaid, associate administrator of NASA’s Office of STEM Engagement. “We hope to cultivate innovative ideas from diverse teams of students, and we are thrilled to continue fostering student contributions to NASA’s mission and work via Space Grant universities, especially as students across the country face many uncertainties. ” “We’ve designed this challenge so that teams have minimal constraints to create genuine out-of-the-box solutions,” said Drew Hope, Game Changing Development program manager at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. “Dealing with lunar dust will require incredibly creative and innovative approaches and collaborating with the Artemis generation through the BIG Idea Challenge is a strategic effort to fuel that type of innovation. ” Interested and eligible teams should submit their notice of intent by September 25, 2020. Proposal and video submissions are due by December 13, 2020. Finalist teams will be invited to present their solutions to a panel of subject matter experts from the agency and industry at the 2021 BIG Idea Forum, planned for November 2021. The 2021 BIG Idea Challenge is sponsored by NASA through a collaboration between STMD’s Game Changing Development program and the Office of STEM Engagement’s National Space Grant College and Fellowship Project (Space Grant).

    "title": "One Chart Shows The Best And Worst Face Mask Types Based on The Latest Research",
    "body": "2020/09/08 - A simple trick can reveal whether your face mask offers sufficient protection: Try blowing out a candle while wearing it. A good mask should prevent you from extinguishing the flame. The rule isn’t foolproof, but it should help weed out masks that aren’t very protective. Ever since the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began recommending cloth masks for the general public in April, researchers have been evaluating the best materials for filtering the coronavirus. An ideal mask blocks both large respiratory droplets from coughs or sneezes - the primary method by which people pass the virus to others - along with smaller airborne particles called aerosols, which are produced when people talk or exhale. It should be sealed around the nose and mouth, since any gaps, holes, or vents could allow droplets to leak out and potentially infect another person. Assuming masks are worn properly, certain materials consistently perform better than others in studies. Based on the latest research, here’s a ranking of the best and worst face coverings: (Yuqing Liu/Insider) ‘Hybrid’ masks are among the safest homemade options As a general rule, mask fabrics should be woven as tightly as possible. That’s why fabrics with higher thread counts are better at filtering particles. It’s also preferable to have more than one layer. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that fabric masks have three layers: an inner layer that absorbs, a middle layer that filters, and an outer layer made from a nonabsorbent material like polyester. N95 masks are the most protective because they seal tightly around the nose and mouth so that very few viral particles seep in or out. They also contain tangled fibres to filter airborne pathogens - the name refers to their minimum 95 percent efficiency at filtering aerosols. A recent Duke study showed that less than 0. 1 percent of droplets were transmitted through an N95 mask while the wearer was speaking. That’s why they’re generally reserved for healthcare workers. Disposable surgical masks are also made of non-woven fabric. A 2013 study found that surgical masks were about three times as effective at blocking influenza aerosols than homemade face masks (that was true, at least, when air flow was slower than a cough but faster than a human breathing during light work). Still, there are homemade options that come close to the level of protection of an N95 or surgical mask. An April study from the University of Chicago determined that “hybrid” masks - combining two layers of 600-thread-count cotton paired with another material like silk, chiffon, or flannel - filter at least 94 percent of small particles (less than 300 nanometres) and at least 96 percent of larger particles (bigger than 300 nanometres). Two layers of 600-thread-count cotton offer a similar level of protection against larger particles, but they weren’t as effective at filtering aerosols. That study, however, conducted measurements at low air-flow rates, so the masks might offer less protection against a cough or sneeze. Still, multiple layers of high-thread-count cotton are preferable to face coverings made from a dishcloth or cotton T-shirt. Fabrics like silk or cotton have more variable performances A June study published in the Journal of Hospital Infection found that masks made from vacuum-cleaner bags were among the most effective alternatives to surgical masks, followed by masks made from tea towels, pillowcases, silk, and 100 percent cotton T-shirts, respectively. Research from the University of Illinois, meanwhile, found that a brand-new dishcloth was slightly more effective than a used 100 percent cotton T-shirt at filtering droplets when a person coughs, sneezes, or talks. That study (which is still awaiting peer review) also found that a used shirt made of 100 percent silk was more effective at filtering high-momentum droplets, likely because silk has electrostatic properties that can help trap smaller viral particles. The University of Chicago study came to a different conclusion, however: Those researchers found that a single layer of natural silk filtered just 54 percent of small particles and 56 percent of larger particles. By contrast, four layers of natural silk filtered 86 percent of small particles and 88 percent of large particles at low air-flow rates. Bandanas and scarves don’t offer great protection Bandanas and scarves have performed poorly in multiple studies. The Journal of Hospital Infection study found that a scarf only reduced a person’s infection risk by 44 percent after they shared a room with an infected person for 30 seconds. After 20 minutes of exposure, the scarf only reduced infection risk by 24 percent. Similarly, the Duke researchers found that bandanas reduced the rate of droplet transmission by a factor of two, which makes them less protective than most other materials. For the most part, though, any mask is better than no mask, with one notable exception: The CDC cautions people not to wear masks with built-in valves or vents. Masks with one-way valves can expel infectious particles into the atmosphere, helping to fuel transmission. Mask studies should be taken with a grain of salt Although research is coalescing around the idea that a few types of masks offer the best protection, it’s not always easy to simulate how a mask will perform in real life. That’s because only some tests directly mimic the size of novel coronavirus particles, while others evaluate performance based on viruses like influenza. Researchers also still aren’t sure about the degree to which the virus gets transmitted via aerosols, since those tiny particles are extremely hard to trap and study without killing the virus. Some scientists even have different ideas of what constitutes an aerosol - the generally accepted cutoff is less than 5 microns (that’s roughly the size of a dust particle) - and many experts think the delineation is arbitrary altogether. Different studies also test masks under different circumstances: Some mimic the heavy air flow produced when a person coughs, while others mimic the air flow when a person is talking or breathing normally. And of course, masks perform differently depending on how they’re worn. That’s why it’s better to stick with more protection over less. This article was originally published by Business Insider.

    "body": "2020/09/08 - The primary mirror of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which will collect and focus light from the cosmic objects, has been completed. It has been developed in Maryland’s Goddard Space Flight Centre of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). With the help of this mirror, the telescope will capture space vistas, which will be better than Hubble space telescope, informed NASA. The field of view achieved with the help of this telescope will be 100 times more than Hubble images. Reacting to the progress made by his team, Scott Smith, manager of Roman telescope, said that it is very exciting for them to have achieved this milestone. He said, “Success relies on a team with each person doing their part, and it’s especially true in our current challenging environment. “ The scientists have used ultralow-expansion glass in the making of this primary mirror. This has been keeping in mind the fact that the mirror will experience a wide range of temperatures between earth and space. The primary mirror will send light to the Wide Field and Coronagraph instrument of the Roman telescope. The Wide Field instrument will help scientists to map the distribution and structure of invisible dark matter. It will also help in studying the planetary systems and evolution of the universe. The Coronagraph instrument will help in completely restricting the glare of the stars. This will enable astronomers to directly image planets. The vantage point of this telescope will be around 1. 5 million kilometers away from the Earth. The additional testing of the mirror will be conducted at L3Harris Technologies. Although the testing has happened at different temperatures, the new test will happen while it will be attached to its support structure. Smith believes that their work is not over even though they have made the primary mirror. He said, “We’re excited to see this mission through to launch and beyond, and eager to witness the wonders it will reveal. ” "

    "title": "Something Strange Happens on Mars During a Solar Eclipse",
    "body": "2020/09/08 - The moons of Mars are not quite like our Earth’s Moon. Phobos, the larger of the two, is much closer to its planet; compared to the Moon’s 27-day orbit, Phobos swings around Mars in line with the planet’s equator thrice every Martian day (sol). Solar eclipses, therefore, are much more frequent than those here on Earth. Phobos passes in front of - but never entirely covers - the Sun for an annular or partial eclipse somewhere on Mars most sols. Because Phobos is moving so fast, it never transits for more than 30 seconds. But, even during this brief time, the Mars InSight lander has recorded something peculiar happening. To the surprise of Mars scientists, during Phobos eclipses, the lander’s seismometer - the instrument that records ground motions to monitor possible quake activity - tilts, just an infinitesimal little bit, towards one side. Researchers at ETH Zurich’s Institute of Geophysics were actually studying data from Mars InSight to see if some of the effects of eclipses here on Earth also occur on Mars. Specifically: “When Earth experiences a solar eclipse, instruments can detect a decline in temperature and rapid gusts of wind, as the atmosphere cools in one particular place and air rushes away from that spot,” explained seismologist Simon Stähler of ETH Zurich. InSight is equipped with temperature and wind sensors - but these recorded no change in the atmosphere during Phobos transits. Atmospheric turbulence, atmospheric temperature, and barometric pressure remained pretty much consistent with a normal sol. The solar cells did, however, register the transits. Actually, it would be very curious if they didn’t, since Phobos can block as much as 40 percent of the Sun’s light - so it was reassuring that something went according to plan. “When Phobos is in front of the Sun, less sunlight reaches the solar cells, and these in turn produce less electricity,” Stähler said. “The decline in light exposure caused by Phobos’s shadow can be measured. ” But that was the extent of the “expected”. Because both the magnetometer and the seismometer chimed in with odd readings - the seismometer with its unexpected tilt. Actually, the oddity with the magnetometer - used to monitor the magnetic field on the Martian surface - was pretty easy to figure out. Two components showed a decrease very similar to the decrease in the current from the solar array. So the scientists deduced that the decreased current was likely the cause. “But we didn’t expect this seismometer reading; it’s an unusual signal,” Stähler said. “Imagine a 5-​franc coin; now, push two silver atoms under one edge. That’s the incline we’re talking about: 10^-8. ” It doesn’t seem to be a false positive; the signal is recorded for three transits, faint but real. The team expected that it might be a seismic response to the moon’s tidal - that is, gravitational - pull as it passed overhead. However, when they compared it to other readings of seismic activity from Mars, the signal bore no similarity to previous seismic activity. Another possibility is that the tether connecting the seismometer to the lander contracted. However, this would have produced a tilt in the opposite direction to what was observed. And a change in atmospheric temperature could have introduced a density change that nudged the seismometer, but, as we have already discussed, no such change was detected. But there was one more signal. An infrared radiometer recorded a slight drop in surface temperature during the longest transit, followed by a period of about a minute and a half while the ground warmed back up to its pre-transit temperature. This, the team believes, is the most likely cause of the strange reading. “During an eclipse, the ground cools,” said seismologist Martin van Driel of ETH Zurich. “It deforms unevenly, which tilts the instrument. ” A similar effect was observed in 1997, at the Black Forest Observatory in Germany. A technician forgot to turn off the light when leaving the seismometer vault, resulting in elevated noise in long-period data as the warmth from the bulb expanded the granite on which the seismometer rested. A series of experiments with artificial heat sources ensued, demonstrating that seismometers react almost instantaneously to heat changes in the seismic pillar. The team repeated their own version of this experiment, and found that they were able to obtain a signal consistent with the tilting of InSight’s seismometer. This information could be used to better understand Phobos and Mars, the researchers said. For one, InSight’s location is very accurately mapped. Knowing when a Phobos eclipse begins and ends at that location could help scientists more accurately constrain its orbit. And that, in turn, could help us understand what’s in store for Phobos’ future. The moon’s orbit is decaying at a rate of 1. 8 centimetres per year, slowing as it goes; eventually, scientists predict, it will grow so close to Mars that tidal forces will tear Phobos apart, turning it into a ring of debris circling Mars. If the slowdown can be characterised, that can tell us how elastic and warm the planet’s interior is - or how inelastic and cool. And that, in turn, can shed some light on Mars’ formation history. The research has been published in Geophysical Research Letters. "

    "title": "Meta DNA structures transform the DNA nanotechnology world",
    "body": "2020/09/08 - Meta-DNA structures transform the DNA nanotechnology world (Nanowerk News) A team of scientists from Arizona State University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) led by Hao Yan, ASU’s Milton Glick Professor in the School of Molecular Sciences, and director of the ASU Biodesign Institute’s Center for Molecular Design and Biomimetics, has just announced the creation of a new type of meta-DNA structures that will open up the fields of optoelectronics (including information storage and encryption) as well as synthetic biology. This research was published in Nature Chemistry (“Meta-DNA structures”) – indeed the meta-DNA self-assembly concept may totally transform the microscopic world of structural DNA nanotechnology. Models and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of various 3D polyhedra that were constructed by connecting the self-linked triangular M-DNA and rectangular M-DNA. From left to right: a tetrahedron, triangular bipyramid, octahedron, pentagonal bipyramid, triangular prism, rectangular prism, pentagonal and hexagonal prisms. (Image: Hao Yan) (click on image to enlarge) It is common knowledge that the predictable nature of Watson-Crick base-pairing and the structural features of DNA have allowed DNA to be used as a versatile building block to engineer sophisticated nanoscale structures and devices. “A milestone in DNA technology was certainly the invention of DNA origami, where a long single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is folded into designated shapes with the help of hundreds of short DNA staple strands,” explained Yan. “However it has been challenging to assemble larger (micron to millimeter) sized DNA architectures which up until recently has limited the use of DNA origami. ” The new micron sized structures are on the order of the width of a human hair which is 1000 times larger than the original DNA nanostructures. Ever since gracing the cover of Science Magazine in 2011 with their elegant DNA origami nanostructures, Yan and collaborators have been working tirelessly, capitalizing on inspiration from nature, seeking to solve complex human problems. “In this current research we developed a versatile “meta-DNA” (M-DNA) strategy that allowed various sub-micrometer to micrometer sized DNA structures to self-assemble in a manner similar to how simple short DNA strands self-assemble at the nanoscale level,” said Yan. The group demonstrated that a 6-helix bundle DNA origami nanostructure in the sub-micrometer scale (meta-DNA) could be used as a magnified analogue of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and that two meta-DNAs containing complementary “meta-base pairs” could form double helices with programmed handedness and helical pitches. Using meta-DNA building blocks they have constructed a series of sub-micrometer to micrometer scale DNA architectures, including meta-multi-arm junctions, 3D polyhedrons, and various 2D/3D lattices. They also demonstrated a hierarchical strand-displacement reaction on meta-DNA to transfer the dynamic features of DNA to the meta-DNA. With the help of assistant professor Petr Sulc (SMS) they used a coarse-grained computational model of the DNA to simulate the double-stranded M-DNA structure and to understand the different yields of left-handed and right-handed structures that were obtained. Further, by just changing the local flexibility of the individual M-DNA and their interactions, they were able to build a series of sub-micrometer or micron-scale DNA structures from 1D to 3D with a wide variety of geometric shapes, including meta-junctions, meta-double crossover tiles (M-DX), tetrahedrons, octahedrons, prisms, and six types of closely packed lattices. In the future, more complicated circuits, molecular motors, and nanodevices could be rationally designed using M-DNA and used in applications related to biosensing and molecular computation. This research will make the creation of dynamic micron-scale DNA structures, that are reconfigurable upon stimulation, significantly more feasible. The authors anticipate that the introduction of this M-DNA strategy will transform DNA nanotechnology from the nanometer to the microscopic scale. This will create a range of complex static and dynamic structures in the sub-micrometer and micron-scale that will enable many new applications. "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - Following the results of our previous low frequency searches for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), directed toward the Galactic Centre and the Orion Molecular Cloud (Galactic Anticentre), we report a new large-scale survey toward the Vela region with the lowest upper limits thus far obtained with the MWA. Using the MWA in the frequency range 98-128 MHz over a 17 hour period, a ∼400 deg2 field centred on the Vela Supernova Remnant was observed with a frequency resolution of 10 kHz. Within this field there are six known exoplanets. At the positions of these exoplanets, we searched for narrow band signals consistent with radio transmissions from intelligent civilizations. No unknown signals were found with a 5sigma detection threshold. In total, across this work plus our two previous surveys, we have now examined 75 known exoplanets at low frequencies. In addition to the known exoplanets, we have included in our analysis the calculation of the Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) upper limits toward over 10 million stellar sources in the Vela field with known distances from Gaia (assuming a 10 kHz transmission bandwidth).

    "body": "2020/09/08 - This August 2020 photo shows a normal mouse and a “twice-muscled” mouse developed at the The Jackson Laboratory of the University of Connecticut School of Medicine in Farmington. (Photo:AP) Bulked-up, mutant “mighty mice” held onto their muscle during a monthlong stay at the International Space Station, returning to Earth with ripped bodybuilder physiques, scientists reported on Monday. The findings hold promise for preventing muscle and bone loss in astronauts on prolonged space trips like Mars missions, as well as people on Earth who are confined to bed or need wheelchairs. A research team led by Dr Se-Jin Lee of the Jackson Laboratory in Connecticut sent 40 young female black mice to the space station in December, launching aboard a SpaceX rocket. In a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Lee said the 24 regular untreated mice lost considerable muscle and bone mass in weightlessness as expected — up to 18%. But the eight genetically engineered “mighty mice” launched with double the muscle maintained their bulk. Their muscles appeared to be comparable to similar “mighty mice” that stayed behind at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. In addition, eight normal mice that received “mighty mouse” treatment in space returned to Earth with dramatically bigger muscles. The treatment involves blocking a pair of proteins that typically limit muscle mass. A SpaceX capsule brought all 40 mice back in good condition, parachuting into the Pacific off the California coast in January. Some of the ordinary mice were injected with the “mighty mice” drug after returning and quickly built up more muscle than their untreated companions, Lee said. The scientists completed the experiment just as the coronavirus was hitting the US. “The only silver lining of COVID is that we had time to write it up very intensively” and submit the results for publication, said Dr Emily Germain-Lee of Connecticut Children’s Medical Centre, Lee’s wife who also took part in the study. Both are affiliated with the University of Connecticut. While encouraged by their findings, the couple said much more work needs to be done before testing the drug on people to build up muscle and bone, without serious side effects. “We’re years away. But that’s how everything is when you go from mouse to human studies,” Germain-Lee said. Lee said the experiment pointed out other molecules and signalling pathways worth investigating — “an embarrassment of riches…so many things we’d like to pursue. ” His next step: possibly sending more “mighty mice” to the space station for an even longer stay. Three NASA astronauts looked after the space mice, performing body scans and injections: Christina Koch and Jessica Meir, who performed the first all-female spacewalk last fall, and Andrew Morgan.

Everything went smoothly, however, making it the second such successful test flight. The company first pulled off a hop flight in August.

    "body": "2020/09/08 - It is no secret that the pollution in our environment is growing at an exponential rate, and the COVID-19 lockdown has done nothing to tame it. Most of the carbon dioxide is either absorbed by the air, in the atmosphere or absorbed by water bodies. Pixabay While researchers have been able to quantify emissions around the world. The bifurcation between how much is absorbed by the water versus how much is absorbed by the atmosphere is difficult to measure. And now, a recent study has revealed that the world’s oceans are soaking around 900 million metric tonnes of CO2. Just to put things into perspective, this is equal to ten percent of global fossil fuel emissions. This is according to researchers from the University of Exeter. They looked at total CO2 flux (flux meaning movement of greenhouse gases) from the year 1992 to 2018. They discovered that by accounting for the subsurface water, total carbon movement nearly doubled in some regions. Unsplash Professor Andrew Watson, of Exeter’s Global Systems Institute, explained, “Half of the carbon dioxide we emit doesn’t stay in the atmosphere but is taken up by the oceans and land vegetation ‘sinks’. Previous studies that have done this have, however, ignored small temperature differences between the surface of the ocean and the depth of a few metres where the measurements are made. Those differences are important because carbon dioxide solubility depends very strongly on temperature. ” He added, “We used satellite data to correct for these temperature differences, and when we do that it makes a big difference - we get a substantially larger flux going into the ocean. The difference in ocean uptake we calculate amounts to about 10 percent of global fossil fuel emissions. ” Why is more carbon emissions in oceans worrying? Even though CO2 in the air is mostly responsible for global warming and thus, less CO2 in the air equals that much better air quality, the damage it does to the oceans is considerable. Unsplash Researchers state that CO2 in a marine ecosystem turns water more acidic, which results in catastrophic damage to the already endangered coral reefs, resulting in coral bleaching. This causes creatures in that region to migrate while making them susceptible to danger. "

While it comes as one more confirmation of the presence of water on the surface of our natural satellite, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) also believes that the Earth may have had a role to play in the development of this rust. Union Minister Jitendra Singh said regarding the matter, “ISRO’s maiden mission to the Moon has sent images which show that the Moon may be rusting along the poles. The sign of this finding is that even though the surface of the Moon is known to have iron-rich rocks, it is not known for the presence of water and oxygen, which are the two elements needed to interact with iron to create rust. ” Meanwhile, scientists from NASA have asserted that the earth’s oxygen very well had a role to play in the formation of this rust since hematite normally requires both oxygen and water.

    "body": "2020/09/08 - “Mars ain’t the kind of place to raise your kids,” Elton John helpfully informed us in “Rocket Man” nearly 50 years ago. And the emotions experienced by the song’s protagonist – a wistful astronaut having to leave his family behind for a journey to the Red Planet – lay at the heart of Netflix’s lavish new drama, “Away. ” It speaks volumes about the show’s lack of nuance that “Rocket Man” makes an appearance on the soundtrack early on, along with Debussy’s “Clair de Lune,” the Grateful Dead’s “Ship of Fools” and Van Morrison’s “Into the Mystic,” to hammer home its themes. But damned if it doesn’t all combine to create a celestial soap opera that’s as subtle as an asteroid but equally impactful. While most Earthlings are increasingly insistent that “There is no Planet B,” that message clearly hasn’t reached television executives – because by my count, “Away” is the fourth TV drama in the past five years to focus on a manned mission to Mars (not to mention Matt Damon and his “secret sauce” potatoes in Ridley Scott’s 2015 blockbuster “The Martian”). I’m guessing few people saw National Geographic’s “Mars,” about an attempt to colonize the planet in 2033, or the French drama “Missions,” a curio that unfolded over two seasons in 25-minute chunks, with the crew arriving on Mars at the end of the very first episode. The most high-profile show until now was Hulu’s “The First,”which remained frustratingly earthbound as it chronicled Sean Penn’s efforts to get a NASA mission to Mars off the ground after its predecessor experienced a catastrophic failure at takeoff. That 2018 show, which often seemed to exist as an excuse for Penn to show off his abs, suffered a similar fate, being canceled after only eight episodes. (The one thing it got right that “Away” ignores is the political question of why we should be spending billions on a space program while Earth goes to hell in a handbasket. “Away,” in comparison, is a glorified advert for NASA. ) So much baggage At the start of “Away,” the five-person crew on the three-year inaugural mission to Mars is already stationed on a lunar base and counting down the hours until blastoff. For viewers, the biggest question will be how their spaceship, Atlas I, could possibly take off given the amount of baggage each astronaut is carrying. As befits a streaming giant with a global reach rivaled only by the coronavirus, our five astronauts are drawn from four global superpowers, and Britain. The NASA Mars Joint Initiative is led – surprise! – by an American: commander Emma Green (Hilary Swank). Her second-in-command is Ram (Ray Panthaki), an Indian officer who’s loyal to his boss to a fault. Then there’s Russian engineer Misha (wonderfully portrayed by Israeli actor Mark Ivanir), who steals every scene as the experienced cosmonaut whose gruff exterior hides an even gruffer interior; Chinese chemist Wang Lu (Vivian Wu), the archetypally – nay stereotypically – dutiful professional who has left her family behind to become the first person to step foot on Mars; and British botanist Kwesi (Ato Essandoh), who has a crazy backstory we’ll get to later. Open gallery view Hilary Swank as Emma Green in Netflix’s “Away. ” Credit: /AP “The ‘right stuff’ isn’t about ego or swagger anymore. … It’s not about conquering space, it’s about enduring it,” Green says at one point – and boy does she have plenty to endure. Not content with experiencing a bad case of the working mom blues after “abandoning” her 15-year-old daughter Alexis (Talitha Eliana Bateman) for 36 months, there’s also the small matter of her partner, Matt (Josh Charles) – a NASA man himself – suffering a debilitating stroke while she’s on the lunar base and the mission nears its launch. The script’s most frequently repeated command is surely “Emma starts sobbing,” and Swank’s character may well prove too much for some. I can’t say the “Million Dollar Baby” star is my favorite actress, but there’s something about her performance here – in which she balances personal anguish with a desire to literally reach for the stars – that feels compellingly real, even allowing for the histrionics. Those scripts, mostly penned by Jessica Goldberg (“The Path”), generally manage to navigate between serving up plausible-ish, engaging characters and large-scale spectacle – such as a tense space walk set-piece early on, upon which the future of the mission depends. I did say it wasn’t subtle, right? This is a show that, ultimately, is not afraid to embrace its own cheesiness, offering us choice dialogue like “The further away I get, I’m actually just getting closer to getting back to you. ” In space, it turns out, no one can hear you scream – but they can hear you emoting, no matter what your nationality. Sitting alongside Emma’s parental guilt are her fellow travelers’ own problems: estranged offspring, secret loves, dead siblings and parents, health issues. Consequently, over the 10 episodes (the show has yet to be renewed for a second season), we’re put through the emotional wringer in a manner that’s actually more befitting of a medical drama than sci-fi show. For sure, no one watching “Away” is going to mistake it for Andrei Tarkovsy’s solemn sci-fi epic “Solaris. ” But with its flashbacks to pivotal events on Earth and dramatic incidents aboard the Atlas I, the show carries an undeniable charge. With the spaceship itself seemingly operating on autopilot for most of the eight-month journey to Mars, most of the buttons being pressed are seeking to secure an emotional response from the viewer. Deep space loneliness There are elements here of “Apollo 13” (the spaceship looks impressive, but it turns out to be a bit of a Friday vehicle), “Deep Impact” (a chaste love affair between two teens while potentially cataclysmic events take place in the heavens) and, yes, “Solaris,” with its depiction of deep space loneliness and memories of partners left behind on the Blue Planet. Open gallery view Ato Essandoh as Jewish botanist Kwesi as Misha (Israeli actor Mark Ivanir) looks on, in Netflix’s “Away. ” Credit: DIYAH PERA/NETFLIX “Away” also looks fantastic, its depictions of the crew experiencing zero-gravity conditions presented in such a matter-of-fact manner as to seem almost mundane. I particularly liked the scene in which the crew partake in some of Misha’s homemade vodka – alcoholic droplets floating playfully in the air as the astronauts squeeze them out of a syringe – and whenever they glide around the flight deck like modern-day Peter Pans. One of the show’s most interesting choices is to root some of the drama around religious beliefs, given the perpetual state of unhipness religion enjoys in most artistic circles. In this technological world where so much of the wonder is man-made, Kwesi is presented to us as a man of faith – and his journey from Ghanaian orphan to Torah-quoting Jewish botanist is definitely one of the most unusual backstories I’ve seen in quite some time, involving as it does his being adopted as a child by a super-rich Jewish woman and her Ghanaian partner. Then there’s Alexis’ new boyfriend, Isaac, whose idea of a hot date is to take “Lex” to Midnight Mass at Christmastime. I suspect this wholesome family drama may have the same effect on some viewers as NASA’s notorious “vomit comet” training aircraft had on wannabe astronauts back in the day. But there’s plenty to enjoy for those with sturdy stomachs and the inclination to check their cynicism at the door. “Away” is out now on Netflix "

(Reuters image) Asteroid 2020 news: Asteroids safely pass by Earth all the time, and there is no known asteroid impact threat for the next 100 years, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Asteroid Watch has said. NASA’s statement has debunked the common hearsay that most asteroids pose a threat to the Earth. Allaying the fear, NASA Asteroid Watch has indicated that civilisation-threatening risk from spatial objects is rarest of rare. “Regardless, stories sometimes surface with alarming headlines surrounding particular asteroids, so we like to reassure everyone when we see such conversations,” NASA Asteroid Watch said. The NASA Asteroid Watch has made the observation after an Asteroid named 465824 2010 FR — twice as big as the Pyramid of Giza— was expected to enter the Earth’s orbit on September 6. Now, descriptions such as “rocky horror” and “dangerous asteroid” emerged. “Our #PlanetaryDefense experts are not worried about asteroid 2010 FR and you shouldn’t be either because it has zero chance of hitting Earth. It will safely pass by our planet on September 6 more than 4. 6 million miles away—that’s more than 19 times the distance of our Moon!” NASA Asteroid Watch tweeted. Asteroids are described as rocky objects that orbit the Sun. However, these are much smaller than planets and also called minor planets. As many as 994,383 known asteroids are there as remnants from the formation of the solar system over 4. 6 billion years ago, as per NASA. There are three types of Asteroids. Firstly, there are Asteroids that are found in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Secondly, there are asteroids that share an orbit with a larger planet and these are known as trojans. The third type of Asteroids is Near-Earth Asteroids (NEA). These Asteroids generally pass close by the Earth. Among these, there are Earth-crossers which cross the Earth’s orbit. There are more than 10,000 such asteroids and out of which over 1,400 are classified as potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs). According to NASA’s Near-Earth Object Observations Programme, Asteroids with 140 metres or larger are of “the greatest concern”. However, NASA has been pointed out that no asteroid larger than 140 metres has a “significant” chance of hitting the Earth for the next 100 years, as per the Indian Express report. "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - Even though dark matter comprises 85 per cent of all matter in the universe, it does not interact with light and can only be seen through the gravitational influence it has on light and other matter. So what does dark matter look like? Recently, a team from Harvard &amp; Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics carried out a detailed simulation of the dark matter cosmos, resulting in some surprising observations. As per a statement released on Universe Today, the accuracy of any dark matter simulation depends on the assumptions one makes about it. In this case, the team assumed that dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) with a mass about 100 times that of a proton. According to study authors, WIMPs are one of the more popular theories of dark matter and similar computer simulations of WIMP dark matter have been done before. What set apart this simulation was that it was exceptionally high in resolution and featured on a scale ranging across thirty orders of magnitude. Researchers found that dark matter is formed in halos around galaxies. They also found that the haloes developed across all mass scales, ranging from small, planet mass haloes to galactic one and even massive haloes that form around clusters of galaxies. Scientists observed that all the haloes had a similar structure where they are dense towards the centre and start diffusing at the edges. The fact that this happened at all scales makes it an explicit feature of dark matter. The researchers revealed that while the small scale haloes are too small to be detected through gravitational influence on light, they could help answer how matter interacts with itself. According to them, one notion about dark matter is that when particles of a dark matter collide, they emit gamma radiations. Gamma ray observations have also been seen emitted from the centre of the Milky Way, which could be caused by dark matter. The simulation showed that most gamma radiation was produced by smaller haloes. Since the scale of a halo would affect the energy spectrum of the gamma rays, this model makes precise predictions about the gamma-ray surplus one should see both in the Milky Way and other galaxies.

Bengaluru based scientists have found that UV and blue light combination reversibly switches the system between 3D and 1D photonic structure — a novel interaction that can help make tunable and effective optical devices. In their quest to develop materials for tunable and effective optical devices, Scientists from the Centre for Nano and Soft Matter Sciences (CeNS), an autonomous institute of the Department of Science &amp; Technology, Govt. of India, have discovered that high levels of light in the blue wavelengths or actinic light lead to switching between two photo isomers — Chiral Nematic (Ch) and Twist Grain Boundary Smectic C* (TGBC*) which are liquid crystal phases possessing photonic structures in one and three dimensions, respectively. This work involving the research team of Rajalaxmi Sahoo, D. S. Shankar Rao, U. S. Hiremath, C. V. Yelamaggad, and S. Krishna Prasad from CeNS, has been published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry. The change occurs because of interactions between light and molecules leading to photoisomerization in which light of a specific wavelength (actinic light) can bend molecules with certain linking groups. A well-known example in this regard involves a change in the shape of a macromolecule of azobenzene derivatives from essentially linear to highly bent form when irradiated with Ultraviolet light (~ 365 nm). The phenomenon found by the CeNS involves reverse transformation on stimulation with blue light. This phenomenon is quite attractive to achieve photo-driven isothermal phase transitions in liquid crystal (LC) materials. Such photoresponsive LCs are attractive for applications, including flexible polarisers, patterned objects, logic devices, and energy harvesting materials. The present study also shows that photonic wavelength variations of over 100 nanometres can easily be achieved reversibly within a few tens of seconds, a feature that can find applications ranging from low reflection lenses and high reflection mirrors to colour changing paints and inks.

    "title": "Two Mammoth Impossible Black Holes Merge to Mark Most Massive Collision Ever Detected",
    "body": "2020/09/08 -  Artist’s impression of the binary black holes merger. (Mark Myers, ARC Centre of Excellence for Gravitational Wave Discovery (OzGrav)) At a Glance On May 21, 2019, astronomers detected four short wiggles of gravitational waves passing through the Earth. It was detected from a source which is five gigaparsecs away. The merger of the two black holes has led to the formation of new class known as intermediate-mass black holes (IMBH). A long time ago, seven billion years ago to be precise, two blackholes—deemed physically impossible to exist—collided to produce a cataclysmic explosion. On May 21, 2019, astronomers detected four short wiggles of gravitational waves passing through the Earth. The source of these signals has been traced back to this seven-billion-year-old collision, which happened more than ten billion light-years away. The discovery of this most massive source of gravitational waves to be detected so far were published in a peer-reviewed journal this week. The ripples coming from this insanely far away collision were picked by Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) based in the United States and its counterpart in Italy named Virgo. The discovery was published exactly five years after the first-ever gravitational wave was detected in September 2015. The gravitational waves are the disturbances or ripples in the space-time continuum caused by some of the most violent and energetic processes in the Universe. The existence of gravitational waves was first predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916 through his general theory of relativity and was empirically proved a century later. Most distant signal yet The short gravitational signal received by the LIGO in May 2019 was named GW190521 from a collision of two massive black holes. LIGO detected the ripples in the space-time continuum as four short wiggles, which lasted one-tenth of a second. It was detected from a source which is five gigaparsecs away, thus making it one of the most distant gravitational sources to be detected by LIGO. The signals were generated from two binary black hole mergers, both of whom lie in the ‘impossible’ range of black holes in terms of mass. The research paper explains that the two highly spinning black holes—about 66 and 85 times more than the mass of the Sun—collided and merged. The collision released an enormous amount of energy that spread across the universe in the form of gravitational waves. But this in itself has come as a surprise for the scientists. As per the statement from the Australian National University (ANU), whose scientists were involved in the discovery, the merger of the two black holes has led to the formation of a class black hole known as intermediate-mass black holes (IMBH) that has remained elusive for scientists so far. Mass of the black holes All the black holes detected till date largely fall into two categories: stellar-mass black holes (less than 100 solar masses) and a supermassive black hole (more than 1,000 solar masses). The black holes which have masses more than 100 to between 100,000 solar masses are IMBH. As per the research, these two black holes collided to form a black hole weighing 142 times the mass of the Sun. It is till date the biggest black hole detected through gravitational waves observation. This detection has offered scientists a rare glimpse at one of the classes of black holes never detected before. That’s’ why astronomers call it an ‘impossible’ black hole. “We are very excited to have achieved the first direct observation of an IMBH in this mass range. We also saw how it formed, confirming that IMBHs can be produced through the merger of two smaller black holes,” said Professor Susan Scott from the ANU Research School of Physics, a co-author on the publication. Supermassive black holes (SMBH) are those that are usually at the centre of the galaxies and were formed during the early years of the Universe. Stellar black holes, on the other hand, have a mass less than 100 times that of the Sun and are formed due to the collapse of stars. Merging black holes remain a mystery Another ‘impossible’ aspect of the current discovery is the nature of the merging black holes. Astronomers hypothesize that the stars between 65-130 times the mass of the Sun go through the process known as pair-instability, which results in the star to be blown apart completely and thus leaving nothing behind, definitely not a black hole. Now, the heavier (85) amongst the two merging black holes is said to be the first-ever detection which is within the pair of instability mass gap. So, the question bothering physicists is how does a black hole with a mass in right in-between this ‘instability’ range exist? One popular theory is that the black hole is not a product of a collapsing star, but was a result of a similar merger that might have happened before. But, we are yet to find any such evidence. “The fact that we’re seeing a black hole in this mass gap will make a lot of astrophysicists scratch their heads and try to figure out how these black holes were made,” says Nelson Christensen, member of Virgo. The study was published in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letter this week and can be accessed here . ** For weather, space science and COVID-19 updates on the go, download The Weather Channel App (on Android and iOS store).

Further the authors said, ‘We are losing biodiversity every year, and with every extinct species and population, we lose unique evolutionary history. ’ Currently there are 5,700 surviving types of well evolved mammals. In the previous 126,000 years in any event 351 warm blooded animal species have become wiped out. Of those 80 are known from authentic reports since the year 1500, while all others are just known from fossil or zooarchaeological records. ‘Tobias Andermann from University of Gothenburg in Sweden and his partners applied numerical methodology that applies probabilities to measurable issues to the fossil records to gauge how mammalian annihilation rates have changed in the course of recent years, gathering explicit occasions of rate expands. The analysts anticipated a rate acceleration of ‘unprecedented magnitude’ for the not so distant future. As per the examination the eradications in the previous hundreds of years are just a ‘hint of something larger’ even with approaching terminations of the following decades. Nonetheless, the examination creators likewise note that notwithstanding the hazardous degree of current danger, there is as yet an opportunity, a little fateful opening to forestall annihilation of numerous species by improving conservation endeavors.

Called Optimism, Perseverance’s twin’s test took place in a warehouse at Jet Propulsion Laboratory on 1 September. Engineers now expect to take it out to the Mars Yard — a field of red dirt studded with rocks and other obstacles that stimulate the Red Planet’s surface. According to Anais Zarifian, the mobility testbed engineer at JPL, Optimism is the test robot that comes closest to simulating the actual mission operations Perseverance will experience on Mars. Since Perseverance is not flying to Mars with a mechanic, the team needs to see how Earth-bound vehicle system testbed (VSTB) functions to figure out how hardware and software will perform before they transmit commands to the rover on Mars. Optimism is an acronym for Operational Perseverance Twin for Integration of Mechanisms and Instruments Sent to Mars. Optimism will share space in the Mars Yard with Maggie (Mars automated giant gizmo for integrated engineering), the engineering model that stands in for NASA’s Curiosity rover. NASA’s Matt Stumbo, the lead for the VSTB rover on the testbed team added, “The Curiosity mission has learned lessons from Maggie that were impossible to learn any other way. ” According to Stumbo, since now they have Optimism, it will be easier for them to know everything they need to succeed with the Perseverance mission on Mars. As per NASA, the Mars 2020 mission is part of a larger programme that includes missions to the Moon as a way of preparing human exploration of Mars. "

Image: KIS Another photo shows us what a sunspot, which appears as a darker speck on the surface of the sun, looks like up close. Mashable’s weekend team firmly noted that this image exudes major “butthole vibes. ” Apologies to the entire science community, but hey, it’s true. Image: kis The images come from Europe’s largest solar telescope, GREGOR. They’re some of the first to surface following a major upgrade project that the telescope went through. “This was a very exciting, but also extremely challenging project. In only one year we completely redesigned the optics, mechanics, and electronics to achieve the best possible image quality. ” project lead Dr. Lucia Kleint said in the press release. The team apparently saw a major breakthrough in March 2020 when the global pandemic left them “stranded” at the observatory. They used that time to “set up the optical laboratory from the ground up” but weren’t able to grab images of the sun due to winter snow storms. “When Spain reopened in July,” the release continued, “the team immediately flew back and obtained the highest resolution images of the Sun ever taken by a European telescope. ” The images released in July, meanwhile, came from the Solar Orbiter. That one, a joint project between NASA and the European Space Agency, launched the telescope-equipped satellite into space on Feb. 9. The photos we saw in July come from its first “close” pass by the sun, at roughly 77 million kilometers from the star. GREGOR’s images, meanwhile, were captured here on Earth by a very high-powered telescope. The level of detail evident in the images is incredibly impressive, but so too is the upgrading of the telescope itself. Especially in such a short period of time. “The project was rather risky because such telescope upgrades usually take years, but the great team work and meticulous planning have led to this success,” Dr. Svetlana Berdyugina, director of the Leibniz Institute for Solar Physics, said in a statement. “Now we have a powerful instrument to solve puzzles on the Sun. ” "

It has a history of delivering some incredible astronomical discoveries. It provided the first light image of supernova remnant Cassiopeia A. In the year 2000, high school students used data from the telescope to discover a neutron star in supernova remnant IC 443.  Advertisement -Now it’s helped produce some dazzling images of galaxies, stars, planetary nebulas and supernova remnants. At the risk of stating the obvious: Space is pretty wild.  Advertisement -To be clear, these images aren’t necessarily representative of what can be seen with the human eye. They’ve been put together using data, not just from Chandra, but from multiple other sources. They take what NASA calls a “multiwavelength’ approach, using data across multiple different spectra, from radio waves to gamma rays. Let’s go through them all. M82 X-ray: NASA/CXC; Optical: NASA/STScI Not to be confused with the sick French band M83, NASA says M82 is a galaxy that is “oriented edge-on to Earth”. Abell 2744 NASA/CXC; Optical: NASA/STScI A galaxy cluster image using data from the Chandra and Hubble telescopes. Supernova 1987A (SN 1987A) Radio: ALMA (ESO/NAOJ/NRAO), P. Cigan and R. Indebetouw; NRAO/AUI/NSF, B. Saxton; X-ray: NASA/CXC/SAO/PSU/K. Frank et al. ; Optical: NASA/STScI Probably the wildest image of the lot. According to NASA this is an image of one of the “brightest supernova explosions in centuries”. Eta Carinae NASA/CXC; Ultraviolet/Optical: NASA/STScI; Combined Image: NASA/ESA/N. Smith (University of Arizona), J. Morese (BoldlyGo Instituts) and A. Pagan NASA describes Eta Carinae as “a volatile system containing two massive stars that closely orbit each other”. Cartwheel Galaxy X-ray: NASA/CXC; Optical: NASA/STScI When Fritz Zwicky discovered this galaxy in 1941, he said it was “one of the most complicated structures awaiting its explanation on the basis of stellar dynamics. ” It’s 150,000 light years in diameter. Helix Nebula X-ray: NASA/CXC; Ultraviolet: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SSC; Optical: NASA/STScI(M. Meixner)/ESA/NRAO(T. A. Rector); Infrared: NASA/JPL-Caltech/K. Su It looks like a giant eyeball, but the Helix Nebula is actually a star running out of fuel. Apparently this is what could happen to our sun in 5 billion years. "

    "body": "2020/09/08 -  File photo: Chandrayaan 2 launch. (IANS/PIB) At a Glance Chandrayaan 3 will not carry an orbiter—but will include a lander and a rover to study the lunar surface. Despite the apparent hard landing of the lander, the Chandrayaan-2 mission is believed to be 95-98% successful. The Chandrayaan 1 mission had provided conclusive evidence for the presence of ice water on the poles. India’s Moon mission successor—Chandrayaan-3—may be launched somewhere in early 2021, as per the announcement from the Minister of State for the Department of Space, Jitendra Singh on Sunday. The third lunar mission was earlier scheduled for 2020, but the ongoing pandemic and the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of coronavirus has stalled many of Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) preparations for Chandrayaan 3. Earlier in June, the ISRO had pushed the uncrewed Gaganyaan mission also to a later date. In its second attempt, the Indian space agency is aiming to achieve a soft landing on the south pole of the lunar surface, which is least explored to date. Unlike its predecessor, Chandrayaan 3 will not carry an orbiter—but will include a lander and a rover to study the lunar surface. In one of the earlier announcements this year by ISRO, K Sivan had said, “The Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter will be used for communicating with the lander and rover of Chandrayaan-3 during their mission on the moon. ” Chandrayaan 2. (ISRO/IANS) Moreover, reports suggest ISRO scientists will also be considering incorporating improvements that experts have suggested after analysing what went wrong in the previous mission. One such priority could be ‘strengthening the legs of the lander’ so as to improve its chances of survival in the event of another crash. On September 7, 2019, the lander Vikram crashed on the surface while attempting a soft-land on the Earth’s only natural satellite Moon. As per ISRO, the lander’s trajectory began to deviate at about 2. 1 km above the lunar surface, and the mission control subsequently lost all communication with the lander. The agency failed to re-establish the contact despite persistent efforts for several weeks. Despite the apparent hard landing of the lander, the Chandrayaan-2 mission is believed to be 95-98% successful as all the instruments onboard the orbiter are functioning well and sending back data to ISRO. The mission has helped scientists to study the lunar atmosphere, topography, composition and other details. A decade ago, the Chandrayaan 1 mission had provided conclusive evidence for the presence of ice water on the poles, which is devoid of sunlight. Moreover, recently the data from the mission was also used to examine the presence of rust or hematite on the lunar surface. On the other hand, ISRO continues to rigorously work on one of its most anticipated missions, Gaganyaan—the first-ever human space mission. The training of astronauts has been going on in Russia and a couple of uncrewed precursor missions are likely to take off next year. ** For weather, space science and COVID-19 updates on the go, download The Weather Channel App (on Android and iOS store).

    "body": "2020/09/08 - Suzuki Motor Corp. has deferred its ambitious plan to sell at least 5 million cars a year in India by 2030 in a grim admission that the domestic automotive market will see more pain before a full recovery from the coronavirus-induced turmoil. Suzuki’s largest unit, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, has already trimmed capital expenditure plans for this fiscal, underscoring a squeeze on household incomes and job losses in an economy that contracted the most in four decades in the June quarter. “Earlier, it was established that the Indian market may grow to a scale of 10 million units by 2030. We believe these are achievable numbers. The only thing is that it may need a few more years. Compared to now, it is a huge increase,” said Toshihiro Suzuki, president and chief operating officer, Suzuki Motor Corp. , said at the 60th annual convention of the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (Acma) on Saturday. View Full Image Graphic: Sarvesh Kumar Sharma/Mint Enthused by the potential of the Indian market, Osamu Suzuki, chairman, Suzuki Motor, announced in 2018 that the company expects annual sales in India to grow to 10 million vehicles by 2030, with Suzuki controlling half of the market. This led the automaker to invest in a new plant in Gujarat with a capacity of 750,000 vehicles a year. A second plant with a similar capacity was also planned in Gujarat, to grow Maruti Suzuki’s total capacity in India to 5 million vehicles a year by the end of the decade. Mint reported in July that Maruti Suzuki has suspended building the second plant in Gujarat, which was earlier slated to open by 2021-22. The carmaker has also cut its capex plan for FY21 to ₹2,700 crore from ₹3,248 crore last year. Lower sales and profits at Maruti Suzuki are a cause for worry at its Japanese parent as it contributes more than half of Suzuki’s sales and profits. Analysts attributed Maruti Suzuki’s revision of sales targets to diminishing hopes of an immediate V-shaped recovery in automobile demand in India. “Regulatory environment became quite volatile in 2017, and the affordability of customers took a hit due to the new norms and economic slowdown. Going forward, the number of first-time customers will reduce since car prices have gone up while incomes have remained stagnant,” said Puneet Gupta, associate director, IHS Markit. The data and analytics firm has also lowered its annual sales projection for the Indian light vehicle market to 8 million by 2034, given the prevailing economic conditions. In 2018, the London-based firm predicted annual light-vehicle sales to reach around 9 million to 9. 5 million by 2030. To be sure, India’s automotive sector has been facing headwinds for several quarters, and covid has only worsened it. Vehicle manufacturers have been witnessing a double-digit decline in sales from the second half of FY19 due to economic slowdown, higher insurance costs and an increase in vehicle prices due to transition to new safety and emission norms. R. C. Bhargava, chairman, Maruti Suzuki, said the sales forecast of 10 million by 2030 was made when sales were growing by 8% each year, and Maruti was growing in double-digits. “In the last two fiscals, that has changed and demand for cars will depend on recovery in the economy,” he said, adding that “the decline in sales last year itself “put us in doubt about the 10 million figure”.

    "body": "2020/09/08 - Migrant labourers return to New Delhi from parts of Uttar Pradesh on August 8, 2020. (Express Photo: Praveen Khanna) Although most people expected India’s GDP to show substantial contraction when the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) released the data for the first quarter (April, May, June) of the current financial year on Monday, the broad consensus was that the decline would not exceed 20%. As it turns out, the GDP contracted by 24% per cent in Q1. In other words, the total value of goods and services produced in India in April, May and June this year is 24% less than the total value of goods and services produced in India in the same three months last year. Read in Tamil As Chart 2 bears out, almost all the major indicators of growth in the economy — be it production of cement or consumption of steel — show deep contraction. Even total telephone subscribers saw a contraction in this quarter. What is worse is that, because of the widespread lockdowns, the data quality is sub-optimal and most observers expect this number to worsen when it is revised in due course.

Source: McKinsey and Express Research GrOup. Chart 2: Percentage change in key indicators. Source: Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation Chart 2: Percentage change in key indicators. Source: Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation What is biggest implication? With GDP contracting by more than what most observers expected, it is now believed that the full-year GDP could also worsen. A fairly conservative estimate would be a contraction of 7% for the full financial year. Chart 1 puts this in perspective. Since economic liberalisation in the early 1990s, Indian economy has clocked an average of 7% GDP growth each year. This year, it is likely to turn turtle and contract by 7%.       Also read   Extent of damage clearer, stage set for second stimulus   In terms of the gross value added (a proxy for production and incomes) by different sectors of the economy, data show that barring agriculture, where GVA grew by 3. 4%, all other sectors of the economy saw their incomes fall. The worst affected were construction (–50%), trade, hotels and other services (–47%), manufacturing (–39%), and mining (–23%). It is important to note that these are the sectors that create the maximum new jobs in the country. In a scenario where each of these sectors is contracting so sharply — that is, their output and incomes are falling — it would lead to more and more people either losing jobs (decline in employment) or failing to get one (rise in unemployment). Chart 3; source: McKinsey Chart 3; source: McKinsey What causes GDP contraction? Why hasn’t the government been able to curb it? In any economy, the total demand for goods and services — that is the GDP — is generated from one of the four engines of growth. The biggest engine is consumption demand from private individuals like you. Let’s call it C, and in the Indian economy, this accounted for 56. 4% of all GDP before this quarter. The second biggest engine is the demand generated by private sector businesses. Let’s call it I, and this accounted for 32% of all GDP in India. The third engine is the demand for goods and services generated by the government. Let’s call it G, and it accounted for 11% of India’s GDP. The last engine is the net demand on GDP after we subtract imports from India’s exports. Let’s call it NX. In India’s case, it is the smallest engine and, since India typically imports more than it exports, its effect is negative on the GDP. So total GDP = C + I + G + NX Now look at Chart 4. It shows what has happened to each of the engines in Q1. Chart 4: Engines of growth falter. Source: MoSPI and Express Research GrOup Chart 4: Engines of growth falter. Source: MoSPI and Express Research GrOup Private consumption — the biggest engine driving the Indian economy — has fallen by 27%. In money terms, the fall is of Rs 5,31,803 crore over the same quarter last year. The second biggest engine — investments by businesses — has fallen even harder — it is half of what it was last year same quarter. In money terms, the contraction is Rs 5,33,003 crore. So the two biggest engines, which accounted for over 88% of Indian total GDP, Q1 saw a massive contraction.       Read   LAC chill, GDP fall, Covid surge: storm hits heated markets   The NX or the net export demand has turned positive in this Q1 because India’s imports have crashed more than its exports. While on paper, this provides a boost to overall GDP, it also points to an economy where economic activity has plummeted. That brings us to the last engine of growth — the government. As the data shows, government’s expenditure went up by 16% but this was nowhere near enough to compensate for the loss of demand (power) in other sectors (engines) of the economy. Looking at the absolute numbers gives a clearer picture. When the demand from C and I fell by Rs 10,64,803 crore, the government’s spending increased by just Rs 68,387 crore. In other words, government’s spending increased but it was so meagre that it could cover just 6% of the total fall in demand being experienced by people and businesses. The net result is that while, on paper, government expenditure’s share in the GDP has gone up from 11% to 18% yet the reality is that the overall GDP has declined by 24%. It is the lower level of absolute GDP that is making the government look like a bigger engine of growth than what it is. 📣 Express Explained is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@ieexplained) and stay updated with the latest What is the way out? When incomes fall sharply, private individuals cut back consumption. When private consumption falls sharply, businesses stop investing. Since both of these are voluntary decisions, there is no way to force people to spend more and/or coerce businesses to invest more in the current scenario. The same logic holds for exports and imports as well. Under the circumstances, there is only one engine that can boost GDP and that is the government (G). Only when government spend more — either by building roads and bridges and paying salaries or by directly handing out money — can the economy revive in the short to medium term. If the government does not spend adequately enough then the economy will take a long time to recover.       Read   Only farm sector output sees growth, outpaces overall GDP for 3rd straight quarter   What is holding back the government from spending more? Even before the Covid crisis, government finances were overextended. In other words, it was not only borrowing but borrowing more than what it should have. As a result, today it doesn’t have as much money. It will have to think of some innovative solutions to generate resources. Chart 4 by McKinsey Global Institute provides ways in which an additional 3. 5 per cent of the GDP can be raised by the government. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

    "body": "2020/09/08 - The Trump administration in the United States has started a US-China trade war and has been adding sanctions on Huawei. Now, as per the report, the United States is planning to ban China’s largest semiconductor manufacturer SMIC. SMIC relies on American chipmaking equipment. If the company gets added to the Entity List, that could make it more difficult to obtain the components needed to develop its capabilities and hurt the production of chipsets. The ban on SMIC could badly hurt Huawei given that the company is manufacturing budget HiSilicon Kirin chipsets. As of now, SMIC is the only option left for Huawei given that it has been banned from using chipsets or its related technology by any American company. The US Department of Defence is considering whether the chipmaker aids China’s military and defense apparatus. It alleges that SMIC worked with a large Chinese defense company and that university researchers linked to the military have tailored their work to fit SMIC’s technology. However, the company has denied those accusations. EDITOR’S PICK: Rollme Hero Pro Is World’s First Smartwatch to pack Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 4100+ chip Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), based in Shanghai, was founded in 20000. It recently raised around $7. 8 billion in a secondary listing on the Star Market in July, making it the biggest public offering in China in a decade. For this, the company withdrew its listing from the New York Stock Exchange. Although the company ranks among the top five semiconductor manufacturers in the world, it is far behind its competitors in terms of technology. While the likes of TSMC and Samsung have started manufacturing 5nm chipsets, SMIC is still using the 14nm process for manufacturing smartphone chips. ALWAYS BE THE FIRST TO KNOW - FOLLOW US! "

    "title": "7 Features That Kia Sonet Will Get Over The Hyundai Venue",
    "body": "2020/09/08 - The Kia Sonet will be launched in the Indian market on September 18, 2020, and is expected to be priced between Rs 6. 99 lakh and Rs 12. 99 lakh (ex-showroom) The sub-compact SUV range is one of the busiest spaces in the Indian market, with a total of five offerings currently plying in the segment, and many more to join soon. About a month ago, Kia Motors officially revealed its very own sub-4m SUV, the Sonet, which is all set to be launched on September 18, and will go on to become the third Kia car in the country. While we already know that the Kia Sonet will be sharing its platform, powertrains with the Venue, the former will come with a range of additional features over the latter. We have put together a list of the 7 such distinctive features that the upcoming Kia Sonet gets over its cousin and its biggest rival, the Hyundai Venue –  10. 25-inch Touchscreen Infotainment SystemThe Hyundai Venue comes packed with an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system that gets Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Hyundai Blue Link connectivity. On the other hand, Kia will be offering the Sonet with a biggest-in-class 10. 25-inch free-standing touchscreen infotainment system with smartphone connectivity and Kia UVO connected car-tech.  Multi-Drive Modes &amp; Traction ModesThe Sonet comes with three different drive modes, including Eco, Normal and Sport. Depending upon the mode chosen, the car alters its throttle response to deliver however you’d like it to. The Kia sub-4m SUV also gets three different traction modes over the Venue, namely Snow, Mud and Sand, which help you take on different types of terrains.  Fully-Digital Instrument ClusterKia has equipped the Sonet with a 4. 2-inch colour digital instrument cluster that surely goes well with the modern cabin design. The Hyundai Venue gets conventional analogue dials, along with a small multi-info display in the middle.  Ventilated Front SeatsWe’ve already seen ventilated front seats being offered with Hyundai cars like the Creta, Verna, Elantra, as well as both the Kia offerings that are currently on sale i. e. Seltos and Carnival. However, the Sonet will go on to become the first sub-compact SUV in the Indian market that will be offered with this feature, and considering the hot and humid weather of majority of the country, it is surely a welcoming feature at this price point.  Front Parking SensorsThe Mahindra XUV300 was the first car in the segment to be offered with front parking sensors, and the upcoming Kia Sonet will go on to become only the second car to get this safety feature. Front parking sensors are pretty useful when parking in or maneuvering through tight spaces.  Bose Music System with LED Sound Mood LightsWhile the Hyundai Venue does get four speakers and two front tweeters along with Arkamys audio, the Kia Sonet takes it a step ahead with its 7-speaker premium audio system from BOSE, which comes with LED Sound Mood Lights that changes in sync with the beat of the music playing through the car’s media system.  Diesel AutomaticThe Kia Sonet shares its platform as well as its powertrains with the Hyundai Venue. That being said, the Sonet gets the same 1. 2-litre four-cylinder NA petrol engine rated at 83 PS/115 Nm; the 1. 0-litre three-cylinder turbo petrol engine that makes 120 PS of maximum power and 172 Nm of peak torque; as well as the 1. 5-litre diesel motor that puts out 100 PS and 240 Nm. The transmission options include a 5-speed manual transmission for the 1. 2-litre petrol engine; a 6-speed iMT (Intelligent Manual Transmission) and a 7-speed DCT for the 1. 0-litre TGDi turbo petrol engine; and a 6-speed manual gearbox for the 1. 5-litre oil burner (100 PS/240 Nm), similar to the Venue. The Hyundai sub-4m SUV additionally offers an optional 6-speed MT wthe turbo-petrol powertrain. However, unlike the Venue, Kia is offering an optional 6-speed torque converter automatic gearbox for the 1. 5-litre CRDi diesel engine. What’s more is that Kia has decided to keep the power and torque output of the diesel-auto drivetrain the same as the car it is originally borrowed from – the Seltos. That being said, the 1. 5-litre diesel engine when had with the 6-speed auto on the Sonet, produces 115 PS of maximum power and 250 Nm of maximum torque – 15 PS and 10 Nm more than the diesel-manual.

Developed in partnership with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) – National Institute of Virology (NIV), Covaxin is an inactivated vaccine designed to trigger antibodies against the virus. The Phase II trials will enrol 380 participants, said the Joint Drugs Controller of India Dr S Eswara Reddy in a letter sent to Bharat Biotech. According to the Joint Drugs Controller, the directorate had no objection to performing an adaptive, Phase I, followed by Phase II randomised, double-blind, multi-centre study. The study is intended to assess the safety, reactogenicity, tolerability and immunogenicity of the whole-virion inactivated Covid-19 vaccine in healthy participants. A statement from the Directorate General of Health Service read: “This is to inform you that the subject proposal was examined in consultation with SEC (Covid-19) experts held through virtual meeting on 3 September, wherein the committee recommended for the conduct of Phase II part of clinical trials with 380 participants subject to the condition that time for screening the participants should be revised in four days. ” In June this year, Bharat Biotech secured approval from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) to conduct clinical trials of Covaxin, marking the first regulatory nod for the country’s domestic vaccine to enter trials. Last month, the company reported that the vaccine candidate demonstrated an encouraging safety profile in a Phase I trial. The Phase I trial involved 375 volunteers at 12 sites across the country, including Post-Graduate Institute (PGI) of Medical Sciences and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi. Trial investigators collected blood samples from the participants to analyse the vaccine’s immunogenicity. "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - The State Bank of India (SBI) is planning a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) for which over 30,000 employees will be eligible. According to a report in news agency PTI, the state-lender is planning the VRS scheme to optimise its costs. Out of the 2. 49 lakh employees of the bank, at least 30,190 employees are eligible for the VRS scheme, which still awaits the board’s approval. The proposed scheme — ‘Second Innings Tap VRS-2020’ — is aimed at optimising human resources and costs of the bank. If 30 per cent of eligible employees opt for retirement under the scheme, the bank will save Rs 1,662. 86 crore, as per estimates based on July 2020 salary. The news agency PTI said that the draft VRS scheme will provide an option and a ‘respectable exit route’ to employees who have reached a ‘level of saturation in their career, may not be at the peak of their performance, have some personal issue or want to pursue their professional or personal life outside the bank’. SBI VRS Scheme 2020: Eligibility The scheme will be opened to all permanent officers and staff who have put in 25 years of service or completed 55 years of age on the cut-off date. The scheme will open on December 1 and will remain open till the end of February, it said, adding that applications for VRS will be accepted during this period only. As per the proposed eligibility criteria, a total of 11,565 officers and 18,625 staff members will be eligible for the scheme. SBI VRS Scheme 2020: Compensation “The staff member whose request for retirement under VRS is accepted will be paid an ex-gratia amounting 50 per cent of salary for the residual period of service (up to the date of superannuation), subject to a maximum of 18 months’ last drawn salary,” the PTI report quoting the VRS scheme said. Other benefits like gratuity, pension, provident and medical benefits will be given to employees seeking VRS. SBI VRS Scheme 2020: Cooling-off period A staff member retired under the scheme will be eligible for engagement or re-employment in the bank after a cooling-off period of two years from the date of retirement. Ahead of the amalgamation of SBI’s five associates with it in 2017, the merging subsidiaries had announced VRS for their employees. In 2001 also the bank had announced VRS with the objective to optimise human resources. However, the proposed VRS scheme is not finding favour with bank unions. Such a move at a time when the country is in the grip of COVID-19 pandemic reflects anti-worker attitude of management, National Organisation of Bank Workers Vice President Ashwani Rana said. "

    "title": "Airtel and Jio are renaming data caps and misleading consumers",
    "body": "2020/09/08 - When Jio announced “truly unlimited” wireline broadband, many naive people — myself among them — were quick to assume that words had meaning, that telecom operators respected the basic reality of language, and that this would be big for competition in the broadband industry. Then again, the devil is always in the fine print. Both Airtel and Jio, in their respective terms &amp; conditions, say that these “unlimited” high-speed plans actually have a data limit of 3. 3 terabytes. Gizbot was among the publications that first spotted this discrepancy. So essentially, both companies are misleading customers with their plans by inaccurately stating they are ‘unlimited’, and concealing deep in their company’s literature what they call a “commercial usage” limit. So it turns out that instead of challenging the competition, Jio was merely in lockstep with it; Airtel has had the 3. 3TB limit for a while, even as it put out a press release this weekend touting its “unlimited” plans. FUPs are disappearing into the fine print This isn’t new in the wireline broadband industry; Fair Usage Policies, or FUPs, have long been in place to slow down data speeds after customers use a certain amount of data. This age-old practice is essentially a data cap, but instead of ending internet access, ISPs slow it down after. What is new here is that Jio and Airtel, two of the largest telcos in the country, seem to have determined that communicating this limit is no longer necessary. Even in the US, whose fixed-line broadband industry is among the most non-competitive in the world, ISPs like Comcast have an entire page dedicated to telling consumers about a 1. 2 terabyte data cap they have in place in some places. Jio, by the way, does communicate this data cap — but only for “Titanium” users who pay extra for gigabit internet. Those users get 6,600 GB instead of 3,300 GB. Additionally, they get the basic courtesy of knowing what they are paying for. This has the somewhat amusing outcome of Jio’s “unlimited” plan costing less than half of its openly capped Titanium plan, with just a Rs 150 streaming subscription value difference: Jio also moved its clause on the 3. 3TB data limit from the top of its terms and conditions page for Jio Fiber to the bottom, where users are less likely to spot it. Our take: You might argue that 3. 3TB is enough for most people. Then again, that’s not really the point — “enough” does not mean “unlimited”. Vodafone-owned YOU Broadband has data caps that are around 4TB, but these are communicated clearly on its website, and the company doesn’t (for the moment) hide behind legal gray areas to make untrue marketing claims. Even if we do accept this argument of this much data being enough, consider that one hour of video on streaming services consumes a lot more data than it used to. In a family with multiple 1080p or 4k-enabled devices, services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video would suck hundreds of gigabytes from users’ data allowances over a month. Renaming and hiding data caps like this is a dangerous development, as other ISPs may follow suit to attract customers. In a billing cycle where a user has an unexpected hard drive backup restore thrown in, a few days of perfectly reasonable home data use morphs into “commercial usage” that slows down your connection. And a customer who paid for “unlimited” internet may be left scratching their head wondering what exactly that word was supposed to mean.

    "body": "2020/09/08 - Representative photo: AFP BEIJING: Chinese firm Sinovac Biotech Ltd said on Monday its coronavirus vaccine candidate appeared to be safe for older people, according to preliminary results from an early to mid-stage trial, while the immune responses triggered by the vaccine were slightly weaker than younger adults Health officials have been concerned about whether experimental vaccines could safely protect the elderly, whose immune systems usually react less robustly to vaccines, against the virus that has led to nearly 890,000 deaths worldwide. Sinovac’s candidate CoronaVac did not cause severe side effects in a combined Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials launched in May involving 421 participants aged at least 60, Liu Peicheng, Sinovac’s media representative, told Reuters. The complete results have not been published and were not made available to Reuters. Four of the world’s eight vaccines that are in the third phase of trials are from China. For three groups of participants who respectively took two shots of low, medium and high-dose CoronaVac, over 90% of them experienced significant increase in antibody levels, while the levels were slightly lower than those seen in younger subjects but in line with expectation, Liu said in a statement. CoronaVac, being tested in Brazil and Indonesia in the final-stage human trials to evaluate whether it is effective and safe enough to obtain regulatory approvals for mass use, has already been given to tens of thousands of people, including about 90% of Sinovac employees and their families, as part of China’s emergency inoculation scheme to protect people facing high infection risk. The potential vaccine could remain stable for up to three years in storage, Liu said, which might offer Sinovac some advantage in vaccine distribution to regions where cold-chain storage is not an option. Such estimation is extrapolated from the fact that vaccines readings stayed within acceptable ranges for 42 days at 25 Celsius (77 Fahrenheit), 28 days at 37C (98. 6 F), and five months for 2-8C (35. 6-46. 4 F), Liu said, without disclosing complete data.

    "body": "2020/09/08 - New Delhi/Mumbai, September 7 The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday arrested Deepak Kochhar, husband of former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar, in connection with the ICICI Bank loan case. A top ED official told IANS, “Deepak Kochhar has been arrested under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act after daylong questioning. ” He was arrested by the Mumbai branch of the financial probe agency. The action comes almost a year after the ED filed a money laundering case last year on the basis of a complaint registered by the CBI against Videocon Director Venugopal Dhoot, his companies (Videocon International Electronics Ltd and Videocon Industries Ltd), as well as former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar and her husband Deepak. Earlier this year, the ED provisionally attached Rs 78. 15 crore worth movable and immovable assets in possession of ICICI Bank’s former Managing Director and CEO, her husband and the companies owned/controlled by him. During investigation it was revealed that loans were refinanced and new loans aggregating to Rs 1,730 crore sanctioned to Videocon Industries Ltd (VIL) and its group companies and these loans became non-performing assets (NPA) for ICICI Bank on June 30, 2017. Investigation further revealed that an amount of Rs 64 crore, out of the loan of Rs 300 crore sanctioned by a committee headed by Chanda Kochhar to Videocon International Electronics Ltd, was transferred to Nupower Renewables Pvt Ltd (NRPL, earlier known as NuPower Renewables Ltd, a company of Deepak Kochhar) by VIL on September 8, 2009, just one day after disbursement of loan by the ICICI Bank. Further, net revenue of Rs 10. 65 crore were generated by NRL from these tainted funds. Therefore, proceeds of crime amounting to Rs 74. 65 crore were transferred to/generated in NRPL. Investigation also revealed that Chanda Kochhar and her family acquired an apartment in Mumbai owned by one of the Videocon group companies, by way of acquiring that company through her family trust at a nominal price by creating book entries. Accordingly, assets amounting to Rs 74. 54 crore held in the name of Nupower Renewables Pvt Ltd, its subsidiaries, the flat located at Mumbai (book value of Rs 3. 5 crore), and amount of Rs 10. 5 lakh already seized by ED from company of Deepak Kochhar, totalling to Rs 78. 15 crore being proceeds of crime have been provisionally attached by ED under PMLA. — IANS "

    "body": "2020/07/24 - There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Markdown editor If you’ve gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown! As with the last post about the editor, you’ll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we’re using. Special formatting: As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:  strike through ==highlight== *escaped characters*Writing code blocks: There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks: . my-link {  text-decoration: underline;}If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.  Reference lists: The quick brown jumped over the lazy. Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference. Full HTML: Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here’s a standard YouTube embed code as an example: "

			<article class="article-post">                
			<p>NEW DELHI: British premium motorcycle brand Triumph Motorcycles on Thursday (September 10) launched its tourer model, the all-new Rocket 3 GT power cruiser in India priced at Rs 18.40 lakh (ex-showroom). It is priced Rs 40,000 higher than the regular Rocket 3 motorcycle which has been priced at Rs 18 lakh.</p>

<p>The latest version of the Rocket 3 motorcycle looks to create ‘excitement’ in the market which has been reeling under the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>The Rocket 3 GT is the touring variant of the Rocket 3R which was launched in December 2019 and is powered by an all-new 2,500 cc engine, which the company claims is ‘the world’s biggest production motorcycle engine’.</p>

<p>“We are focussing greatly on how to continue to create excitement in this industry. We all know we are stressed in the industry right now. The focus from our side is to continuously give reason for customers to come to our showroom and buy our products,” Triumph Motorcycles India Business Head Shoeb Farooq told PTI. He said the company is focussing on bringing new products with ‘aggressive pricing’ in each segment in order to overcome the current headwinds faced by the industry, specially in the premium motorcycle segment.</p>

<p>“We have launched the Rocket 3 GT at a very very aggressive pricing of Rs 18.40 lakh, which is Rs 40,000 more from the Rocket 3R that we already have. I am sure this is going to go very well with the current context of the situation in the industry,” Farooq said.</p>

<p>Globally, the price difference between Rocket 3 GT and the Rocket 3R could range between Rs 1-2 lakh depending on variant, he added.</p>

<p>Stating that the Rocket 3 GT completes the Rocket range which has the roadster and touring variants, Farooq said,”This is another addition to our already robust BS-VI line-up. We are having the biggest line-up of BS-VI in the premium space. This is the 13th BS-VI motorcycle model we have launched in India.”</p>

<p>The company had started launching its BS-VI compliant models from January onwards though the last four-five months were turbulent.</p>

<p>Triumph Motorcycles said with a weight saving of more than 40kg, the all-new Rocket 3 GT is more than 13 per cent lighter than the previous generation.</p>

<p>It is also equipped with safety features such as optimised cornering anti-lock braking system (ABS) as standard on Rocket 3 GT to maintain optimum braking performance and hill hold control that prevents the bike rolling backwards.</p>

<p>The model is also equipped with features such as turn-by-turn navigation system, cruise control, and keyless ignition.</p>
