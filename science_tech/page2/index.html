The final price for Moderna’s COVID vaccine has yet to be determined, a person familiar with the discussions told Reuters. Moderna Inc is planning to price its coronavirus vaccine at $50 to $60 per course, at least $11 more than another vaccine from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday, citing unnamed sources. Moderna’s proposed price for a two-dose course sold to governments compares with $39 for two doses under a deal that Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech struck with the U. S. government. Industry analysts said Pfizer and BioNTech’s $2 billion deal to cover 50 million patients, which is contingent on an approvable product, would likely pressure other manufacturers to set similar prices. Moderna’s proposed price would apply to the United States and other high-income countries, according to the report.

    "body": "2020/07/29 - Our ever-reliable sources have revealed to us that Samsung’s 2021 flagship Galaxy S lineup will have three different models. That shouldn’t come as a surprise for anyone who hasn’t been living under a rock for the last year or two. The Galaxy S10 was the first Galaxy S series to come in three sizes, and Samsung stuck with that routine for the Galaxy S20 series. Next year looks set to be the same. As of this moment, Samsung has started developing the 5G variants of the three Galaxy S21 models, using model numbers SM-G991, SM-G996, and SM-G998. If Samsung doesn’t mix up the naming scheme, these devices should launch as the Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21+, and Galaxy S21 Ultra, though nothing can be said for certain at this point in time. There will probably be LTE variants as well, but we can’t currently see any sign of them. 128GB and 256GB storage variants, but there could be more We are also told the three Galaxy S21 models are currently in development with 128GB and 256GB of storage. That is probably not a complete list, or maybe it is. Samsung has already done away with 1TB variants of its flagship phones – the last Galaxy flagship to ship with 1TB of internal storage was the Galaxy S10+, and in a post-COVID world where people are less willing to spend huge sums of money on phones, maybe Samsung will cancel the 512GB option as well. But all that is speculation. Although the rumor mill sprung into action months ago, it’s too early to say what the Galaxy S21 lineup will be like. Of course, you can depend on us to break more information about the Galaxy S21 as time goes on. Till then, there’s the Galaxy Note 20 and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra to look forward to, along with the third foldable phone from Samsung, all of which will go official on August 5. "

    "body": "2020/07/29 - Google has reportedly added 23 new insects to its AR search feature, allowing users to virtually see them roaming in their homes. The new insects added to AR search include various kinds of beetles, butterflies, and cicadas. Separately, Google is also testing a new ‘For Context’ feature in Google News. This feature will essentially give you a broader perspective on the primary news search. The contextual link shows up right below the main news, and this context link is usually from the same publication. The Verge reports that Google has added 23 new insects in its AR Search results. This includes rhinoceros beetle, Hercules beetle, Atlas beetle, stag beetle, giant stag, Miyama stag beetle, shining ball scarab beetle, jewel beetle, ladybug, firefly, Rosalia batesi, swallowtail butterfly, morpho butterfly, atlas moth, mantis, grasshopper, dragonfly, hornet, robust cicada, brown cicada, periodical cicada, Walker’s cicada, and evening cicada. Google has added various kinds of beetles and cicadas to AR Search Photo Credit: The Verge To search for the new insects, type the name in search and then click on the ‘View in 3D’ option. The insect will then superimpose into your background and buzz around the house. This feature works only on AR Core supported devices running on Android. iPhone users will need to run on iOS 11 software. Separately, Google has started showing context links in Google News for specific search results. This feature was spotted by Valentin Pletzer, and it appears to be live only on mobile for now. Few Google News stories have an additional small box at the bottom that show context links about the same topic from the same publication. This ‘For Context’ box shows up only for a few publications and only for a few stories for now. Google may be testing it with a few publications, and stories from CNET and Forbes appear to be showing context links. These links look to offer a bigger picture about the primary story in Google News. There is no clarity on when this feature will roll out broadly for all users, and how exactly it will work.

The wearable is a lighter version of Amazfit Bip S (review) that made its debut in India back in back June with Rs 4,999 sticker price. The Amazfit Bip S Lite is priced in India much more reasonably and shares a lot of DNA with its elder sibling such as 1. 28-inch always-on transflective display, optical heart rate sensor, and 5ATM water-resistant. However, the battery life of the watch has been reduced to 30 days from 40 days. The Amazfit Bip S Lite price in India is set at Rs 3,799. The wearable will be available via flash sale from tomorrow, i. e. July 29th, via Flipkart and official Amazfit store. The open sale of the Amazfit Bip S Lite is slated to begin from August 5th onwards. The Amazfit Bip S does not come with built-in GPS and just eight different types of sports mode instead of 10.

    "title": "Amazon Alexa App Gets Its Biggest Refresh Ever And The Focus Is On Continuity Personalization",
    "body": "2020/07/29 - Amazon is giving the Alexa app for Android and iOS a fresh coat of paint, perhaps the biggest in years. The new app will be available for Android, iOS and Amazon’s own Fire OS. There will be visual improvements across the app, updated navigation methods and a more personalized experience based on how you use Alexa, particularly with relation to Skills. Amazon says the update will roll out on the Google Play Store for Android phones, the Apple App Store for the iPhone and on Amazon’s own Fire OS devices over the next month, and everyone should have it in a few weeks. The home screen of the updated Alexa app will now have a large Alexa button at the top, which users can either tap to invoke the virtual assistant or simply say Alexa. Beneath that sit a list of personalized suggestions, which will be based on how you interact with Alexa either on your phone or with any of the Alexa-enabled Echo smart speakers or third-party Alexa smart speakers that you may own. This will include music streaming, including suggestions from third party apps such as Spotify if you have linked any of those accounts, upcoming reminders, music suggestions to pick up from where you left off last and maybe even continue with an audiobook while at it. It is interesting to note that while Amazon is prioritizing Alexa Skills in the updated Alexa app for Android and iPhone, third-party skills have been pushed back to a separate Skills &amp; Games section. This is possibly to simplify the experience for users and not complicate it with skills that they may or may not use often. There are changes to the Reminders, Settings, Routines and Skills menus as well for further simplification. It will be interesting to use the new Alexa app and see how much Amazon’s efforts have managed to simplify the experience for users. Over time, with so many features regularly added and so many Alexa devices now on sale, the app seemed to have become a bit cluttered and it wasn’t exactly intuitive at times when you wanted to find something in a jiffy. The fact that Amazon is now focusing on letting you pick up from where you last left off adds to a continuity that could let you shift music from an Echo speaker at home to the Echo Buds wireless earbuds as you are about to step out of home. The change in how third-party skills are now listed within the app perhaps comes as a result of a recent study that shows most of these remain unused. A research by Voicebot suggests that as many as 61% of Alexa’s third-party skills have no ratings at all, which indicates they aren’t popular. The research also says only 5% of Alexa skills have earned 10 or more ratings and just 1% have more than 100 ratings from users. The new Amazon Alexa app will show up on your Android phone or Apple iPhone’s application stores anytime in the coming weeks. "

    "body": "2020/07/29 - Widely shared social media post claim the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that positive COVID-19 results simply mean people have previously contracted a cold. In reality, the claim is a misinterpretation of a paragraph discussing antibody tests on the CDC’s website. Health experts confirm COVID-19 is detected with viral tests, not an analysis of antibodies. “SHOCKER: CDC admits COVID-19 ‘positive result’ just means you’ve previously contracted the common cold,” one Facebook post says. A screenshot of a false Facebook post, taken on July 23, 2020 Similar Facebook posts from the US have been archived here and here. Also Read: WHO Has Not Said Cats And Dogs Cannot Contract COVID-19 This Polish Facebook post shared a screenshot of the actual paragraph from the CDC’s website. The caption translates to: “American CDC reports that a positive test result (allegedly for COVID-19) could mean that you had any other cold or flu caused by other coronaviruses”. Screenshot of the misleading Polish Facebook post, taken on July 27, 2020 The screenshot used in the post can be found on the CDC website under the topic: “Test for Past Infection (Antibody Test)”. A screenshot of the paragraph (in the red rectangle) on CDC website, taken on July 24, 2020 But health experts say the social media posts have misinterpreted the paragraph – including Kenyan doctor Githinji Gitahi, a board member of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. The institution is part of the African Union and unrelated to the American CDC. Viral test to confirm COVID-19 Gitahi, who also runs the medical NGO Amref Health Africa, told AFP Fact Check there are two types of tests for COVID-19 – the direct or viral test, and the indirect test, also referred to as the antibody test. Blood samples are used to check for traces of antibodies, which indicate if someone was previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 – the virus that causes COVID-19. Also Read: No, WHO Is Not Advertising Home-based Jobs To Fight COVID-19 The viral test, meanwhile, uses samples from the respiratory system, such as a swab from the inside of your nose, throat or lungs to detect an ongoing COVID-19 infection. “Since there is currently no antibody test that is specific to antibodies produced to fight SARS-CoV-2, there is a likelihood to test positive if one tests for antibodies but it might not be because of COVID-19 but because the antibodies came from other coronaviruses, even the one that causes the common cold,” Gitahi said. “Because of this confusion, we do not use the antibody test to confirm COVID-19 infection but we use the viral test, which is conducted in the nose or throat with swabs or in the lungs. ” Antibody tests used for surveillance The US-based CDC told AFP Fact Check that a viral test will not produce a positive result for COVID-19 from the traces of other human coronaviruses. “The viral test detects the SARS-CoV-2 virus in respiratory samples. The presence of other human coronaviruses in a respiratory sample do not produce a positive result on a diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2,” spokeswoman Jasmine Reed said in an email. “A positive result on an antibody test might mean that a person had a past infection with SARS-CoV-2. But there is a small chance that antibodies from an infection with a different coronavirus, such as the one that causes the common cold, might cause a positive result on a SARS-CoV-2 antibody test. ” WHO acknowledges that antibody tests such as serology testing can be used in COVID-19 surveillance to measure the extent of infection in the population. But it cautions against the uncertainty of the test in terms of sensitivity and specificity, and its ability to “assess cross-reactivity” with other coronaviruses. "

    "title": "72 of US adults are wearing masks what is the data for India ",
    "body": "2020/07/29 - Over the past month the Covid map of India has transformed. Not only did 65% of the cases on Sunday come from outside Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi, half of India’s districts now have over 500 cases each. On the good news front treatment protocols are greatly improved and testing capacity is being ramped up sharply in several places, efforts are underway for the country to do a million tests a day in a few weeks, and various vaccine trials are progressing well in the world. But Google extending its global work from home option for employees till June 30 next year is just one of many indicators that the virus shall not be overcome anytime soon. Doing everything possible to arrest its spread is therefore imperative, to limit the wreckage of lives and livelihoods before a vaccine becomes available. Masks are a central part of this defense, their return on investment is quite incomparable. But reflective of the general scarcity of good data in India, we have no nationwide estimate of how prevalent mask wearing has become. A Stanford University study suggests a great disparity in the quality of Covid-19 data reporting across India. Overall there is significant shortage of granular details like age, gender, comorbidities and even districts. But it is this granularity that can make some of the most productive interventions possible. On mask wearing, likewise, if we had the data we could put more public and even private resources into the regions or demographics that have not taken to the habit out of either cultural or financial reasons. In the US, where of course there is a weird political constituency for the cause of not wearing masks, a Fortune magazine and SurveyMonkey poll suggests that 67% of all Americans now wear masks. More heavy-duty polling by Ipsos, Pew and Gallop also enables tracking behavioral improvement over the months. An online Gallup Panel survey conducted between June 29-July 5 found 54% of American women as compared to 34% American men saying that they always wear a mask outside their home, which maybe suggests the need to rope in some serious male/macho role models in public service campaigns about how masks save lives (and jobs). That overall 44% of US adults said they “always” wear a mask when outside their homes and 28% said they do so “very often” indicates how far this simple and yet powerful tool is still from the near universal adoption as seen in countries like Japan. What about India? What percentage of the population is masking up? Which segments are showing resistance? How much of this is for financial reasons? We don’t know. But we should find out. There is the dangling on the neck error. Another widely reported error is pulling down the mask just when one starts talking – Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot did this just last week while addressing a large group of mediapersons crowded next to him, Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan did the same at no less than a Covid ward where he is admitted and from where he was broadcasting to the public with various health service providers also present in the ward. There are also people who are wearing the same mask days on end without washing it regularly. Without essential mask hygiene, like not touching its outer surface because that is at risk of virus deposits, the mask can become useless. Surely there is still not enough conversation about this. And this conversation needs to take place especially with all those who do not have the luxury of work from home, who are out and about in the great Unlock that hopes to put the country on the economic recovery path. Plus, mask prices have dropped considerably. Surgical ones are to be had for Rs 5 now, and bulk prices would be much lower. Governments can make bulk purchases and organize mask distribution camps, where say a week’s supply is handed out alongside basic instructions. This would help put information about proper use into the wider ecosystem, where of course homemade masks also play a key role. Let’s get our act together on this. "

    "body": "2020/07/29 - In an industry where getting one drug developed from lab to clinic can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and decades of time, it helps when scientists can be thrifty and make use of substances that already exist. A global team of researchers has now done just that, by searching through one of the world’s largest collections of already developed drugs to discover 21 potential treatments for COVID-19. We will need considerably more research to determine if any of these drugs can be used to help COVID-19 patients, but it’s an excellent first step, bypassing some of the barriers for producing completely new drugs. “The development of a vaccine is likely to require at least 12-18 months, and the typical timeline for approval of a novel antiviral therapeutic can exceed 10 years,” the team writes in their new paper. “Thus, repurposing of known drugs could significantly accelerate the deployment of novel therapies for COVID-19. ” The researchers took the ReFRAME Drug Repurposing Library - 11,987 compounds which have either received FDA approval or made it to clinical-trials – and began testing them against SARS-CoV-2 in a line of cells called Vero, cultured from the kidney of an African green monkey (Chlorocebus sp. ). “We realised early in the COVID-19 pandemic that ReFRAME would be an invaluable resource for screening for drugs to repurpose against the novel coronavirus,” says medical chemist and study co-author Arnab Chatterjee from Calibr, the drug discovery division of Scripps Research that created ReFRAME. As was expected, the vast majority of the tests didn’t result in much, but the team did find 100 compounds that inhibited viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells. The team then demonstrated that 21 of those 100 compounds had a dose-response relationship – meaning the dose required to be effective wasn’t also likely to cause harm to humans. One of these was remdesivir, so that leaves 20 yet to be tested for COVID-19 treatment. Of those 21 drugs, 13 were found to be effective at concentrations that could be safely used in COVID-19 patients and had previously entered clinical trials. “This study significantly expands the possible therapeutic options for COVID-19 patients, especially since many of the molecules already have clinical safety data in humans,” said virologist Sumit Chanda from Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute in California. “This report provides the scientific community with a larger arsenal of potential weapons that may help bring the ongoing global pandemic to heel. ” The 21 drugs are currently being tested further using small animal models or mini lungs that can mimic human tissue. However, the team has already found three that worked in human stem cell-derived lung tissue, and one showed antiviral effects in a lab-based lung culture system. This is all exciting stuff, but as we’ve seen in many examples so far, caution is needed before rushing into the administration of new drugs, even during a pandemic - not all promising compounds will actually work against COVID-19, even if those drugs have been approved for other ailments in the past. The more treatments we have however, the better. “While some of these drugs are currently in clinical trials for COVID-19, we believe it’s important to pursue additional drug candidates so we have multiple therapeutic options,” says Chanda. The research has been published in Nature. "

The situation has taken a major toll on the mental health of citizens, and has become a major talking point in the last few months. With the series of lockdowns, anxiety, job cuts, health scares, and the overall volatile environment, stress levels are at an all-time high. Copious amounts of stress can lead to depression. With the current lockdown and lifestyles drastically changing, we have seen that 43 per cent of Indians are currently plagued with depression and are learning to cope with it. While 26 per cent Indians facing mild depression, 17 per cent face a more strenuous kind. It is concerning to note that 6 per cent Indians are severely depressed. GOQii, the smart-tech-enabled preventive healthcare platform, conducted a survey across 10,000+ Indians to understand how Covid-19 has changed lifestyle and how Indians are adapting to the new normal. This is a comparative study and highlights the glaring difference in lifestyle habits pre-Coronavirus and post lockdown. Vishal Gondal, founder and CEO, GOQii said, “Our study indicates that an increasing number of people across the country are dealing with mental health issues triggered by the spread of the Coronavirus and the consequent lockdown. The mounting uncertainty is the basis of the high stress index which can be controlled with a balanced diet, changes in lifestyle and appropriate sleep patterns. We at GOQii believe that preventive healthcare is the future and the only viable, long-term solution given the huge load on the healthcare system in India. Mental health has a huge impact on physical health and overall quality of life, hence, addressing it sooner with a healthy and wholesome lifestyle is the only way ahead. ” 59 per cent people show less interest in things According to the self-administered, patient health questionnaire PHQ – 9, consisting of nine areas, monitors the severity of depression and response in a population "

    "body": "2020/07/29 - Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve learned that the coronavirus attacks much more than just your respiratory system. There are symptoms of the virus that affect everything from your mouth to your digestive tract. Now, a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Cardiology has found that one of the more frightening lingering effects of COVID-19 is also very common. According to the JAMA Cardiology study, nearly 80 percent of COVID patients have heart damage. The research, which was conducted out of Germany’s University Hospital Frankfurt, examined the MRI scans of 100 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, most of whom were otherwise healthy and in their 40s and 50s. The scans showed that 78 of the patients (78 percent) had signs of heart damage. Furthermore, 60 percent of the patients showed signs of inflammation. The researchers say these startling findings demonstrate the need for “ongoing investigation of the long-term cardiovascular consequences of COVID-19. ” The study’s lead author, Valentina Putmann, MD, cardiologist and clinical pharmacologist at University Hospital Frankfurt, told Stat, “The fact that 78 percent of ‘recovered’ [patients] had evidence of ongoing heart involvement means that the heart is involved in a majority of patients, even if COVID-19 illness does not scream out with the classical heart symptoms, such as anginal chest pain. ” In a recent paper, JAMA Cardiology editors Clyde W. Yancy, MD, and Gregg C. Fonarow, MD, cite this new study as evidence that they “see the plot thickening. ” They write: “We are inclined to raise a new and very evident concern that cardiomyopathy and heart failure related to COVID-19 may potentially evolve as the natural history of this infection becomes clearer. ” Unfortunately, while the new German study did begin to answer some questions, it also opened the door for even more queries. “The question now is how long these changes persist?” cardiologist Matthew Tomey, MD, who was not involved with the study, told Stat. “Are these going to become chronic effects upon the heart, or are these—we hope—temporary effects on cardiac function that will gradually improve over time?” RELATED: For more up-to-date information, sign up for our daily newsletter.

    "body": "2020/07/29 -       Mumbai   New Delhi: The government may consider lowering the base price of 5G spectrum to compensate telcos if they have to shell out more for buying non-Chinese equipment. Officials said the government was aware that keeping Chinese vendors Huawei and ZTE away from India’s 5G market may push up network deployment costs and is thus open to reassessing the base prices suggested by the regulator to make it viable for operators. “Procurement procedures are being reworked, surveillance has become a global issue and companies such as Huawei and ZTE whose ownership is questionable are going to increasingly find it tough to get contracts,” one official told ET. In such a scenario, excluding Chinese vendors was “a natural progression or outcome of the concerns arising out of national security for countries,” the official said. Experts said the absence of Huawei and ZTE would leave Indian telcos dependent on European vendors Ericsson and Nokia , besides South Korea’s Samsung. This would increase deployment costs by 15-20%, ultimately hurting retail and industrial customers. The officials said the government is aware of the cost implications, especially as the two Chinese companies have historically offered the lowest rates for telecom equipment. Private telcos Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio have termed the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s suggested base price of Rs 492 crore per MHz for 5G spectrum too high. CLSA said in a report that the suggested price was the most exorbitant in the world, with rates in Italy, the US, South Korea and the UK being much lower. According to another government official, the Digital Communications Commission has accepted Trai’s 4G base price recommendations and is yet to decide on the regulator’s 5G pricing suggestions. The commission is an inter-ministerial body that is the highest decision-making group in the department of telecommunications. “This leaves a window of opportunity for the government to lower the 5G prices so that there is better competition during the auction,” the official said. The 4G spectrum auction is likely in October-November, while 5G airwaves may be offered only next year. While the 4G bands can be used to provide 5G services in the future, India has currently earmarked only the 3,300-3,600 MHz bands for the next-generation service. Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani said in mid-July that Jio has developed its own 5G technology, which will be ready for trials as soon as 5G spectrum is available. Telecom operators in India have also applied for spectrum for 5G trials, which have been long delayed. Airtel and Vodafone Idea have applied to partner with Huawei, ZTE, Ericsson and Nokia for the trials, while Jio first proposed a tie-up with Samsung and then decided to go solo. These tie-ups would change if Chinese companies aren’t allowed to participate in the trials.    "

The percentage in India saying productivity has increased is the highest in the Apac region. The survey sampled 300 respondents in India and 2012 in Asia Pacific, across manufacturing, financial services, retail, technology and health. At the same time, employees also cite the loss of productivity due to distractions as a key challenge. This includes time spent on expense claims processes. About 34% of those surveyed were less than satisfied with the current amount of time spent on finance matters. While employees working remotely are being supported digitally in many areas, there still exists a major gap in digital adoption for crucial yet often overlooked finance and administrative processes. Owing to this, employees have to devote significant time for menial tasks that could otherwise be used for productive, business value-added work. ”Bringing in digital transformation for expense claims or invoice processing can have a huge multiplier effect on business and cost control,” said Mankiran Chowhan, MD of SAP Concur’s Indian subcontinent operations. The survey found that only 11% of the companies submit expenses now in a fully digital manner.

White Ops’ Satori threat intelligence team discovered these 29 apps as part of their “CHARTREUSEBLUR” investigation. The word blur in the codename of the investigation is due to the fact that most of the malicious apps were photo editing apps which had a blur feature. As for the word “chartreuse” the team just found it fun to say and that the liquor is tasty. These Android apps were found running out-of-context (OOC) ads which are said to be used to avoid detection. After the user installs any of these apps, the launch icons would immediately disappear from the phone. This made it difficult for users to remove the malicious app from their phones. One such app with adware was the Square Photo Blur app. The Satori team tested this app and discovered a “hollow shell of an app” which managed to pass the Play Store security checks. The app obviously didn’t function as advertised and instead ran OOC ads on phones. Once the app was installed on the phone the launch icon disappeared and there was no “open” function on the Play Store either. Ads that popped on up through these apps happened within intervals of only a few seconds. Also, almost every action the user performed on their phone triggered a code in the app for ads to pop-up. Some of these actions include unlocking the phone, uninstalling an app, charging the phone or even switching from mobile data to Wi-Fi. The ads pop up and occupy the whole screen of the phone. It’s not just ads though. The Square Photo Blur app even managed to launch an OOC web browser randomly. 29 Android apps have been identified with this malicious adware. But there could be more in the future. you can get full list here get the PDF directly. and uninstall them. The Satori team also advises to look out for hints like - reviews of the apps mentioning ads popping up all the time, apps disappearing after downloading it, a lot of 5-star reviews but recent ones are mostly 1-star, app doesn’t work as advertised, app received a lot of downloads in a very short time. Some of these points can act as indicators that the app is probably a malicious one. Google recently removed 11 apps from the Play Store which contained the Joker malware. These apps have been lurking around since 2017. Hackers have managed to introduce new variants of the Joker malware in Android apps.

    "body": "2020/07/24 - Eating chocolate at least once a week is linked with a reduced risk of heart disease, according to research published today in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, a journal of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). “Our study suggests that chocolate helps keep the heart’s blood vessels healthy,” said study author Dr. Chayakrit Krittanawong of Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas. “In the past, clinical studies have shown that chocolate is beneficial for both blood pressure and the lining of blood vessels,” he continued. “I wanted to see if it affects the blood vessels supplying the heart (the coronary arteries) or not. And if it does, is it beneficial or harmful?” The researchers conducted a combined analysis of studies from the past five decades examining the association between chocolate consumption and coronary artery disease (the blockage of the coronary arteries). The analysis included six studies with a total of 336,289 participants who reported their chocolate consumption. During a median follow-up of nearly nine years, 14,043 participants developed coronary artery disease and 4,667 had a heart attack (when coronary artery disease progresses and the flow of blood to the heart is suddenly blocked). Compared with consuming chocolate less than once a week, eating chocolate more than once a week was associated with an 8% decreased risk of coronary artery disease. Dr. Krittanawong said: “Chocolate contains heart-healthy nutrients such as flavonoids, methylxanthines, polyphenols and stearic acid which may reduce inflammation and increase good cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein or HDL cholesterol). ” He noted that the study did not examine whether any particular type of chocolate is more beneficial and whether there is an ideal portion size. “Chocolate appears promising for prevention of coronary artery disease, but more research is needed to pinpoint how much and what kind of chocolate could be recommended,” he said. While it’s not clear how much chocolate is optimal, Dr. Krittanawong warned against overeating. He said: “Moderate amounts of chocolate seem to protect the coronary arteries but it’s likely that large quantities do not. The calories, sugar, milk, and fat in commercially available products need to be considered, particularly in diabetics and obese people. ” Reference: “Association between chocolate consumption and risk of coronary artery disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis” 22 July 2020, European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.

In hot and dry climates, where these droplets cover a distance of only 6 to 8 feet, in cold and damp environments, these droplets can go up to 13 feet. Then even if there is no wind during this… -During the weather changes on droplets coming out of the mouth through breath while coughing and sneezing was done in America. The main objective of doing this research is to know the possibility of spreading any respiratory disease according to the weather. This research has recently been published in General ‘Physics of Fluids’. The special thing is that scientists of Indian origin are doing this research done in America. Why antibodies once made in the body will not protect against corona throughout life? This is the first model in itself that is based on the collagen rate theory of chemical reactions and has been done keeping in mind the speed of propagation of droplets. So that it can be accurately ascertained what is the time and speed of spread of these droplets from an infected person to a healthy person in a season. Cold and damp environment spreads more Corona infection The origin of this chemical process depends on the speed with which the two molecules collide with each other. The sooner these molecules collide with each other, the faster the reaction will be seen. Similarly, the more people who come in contact with droplets released from the body of an infected person, the faster the infection will spread. This is to say the study’s author and Abhishek Saha of the University of California. Handmade Face Mask For Covid-19: Method of making and storing hygienic masks of cotton at home – The researcher says that the distance the droplets will travel from the infected person depends to a large extent on the weather. Droplets released from the infected person’s body through cough and sneezing can go up to 8 to 13 feet. Wind speeds have not been added to this speed of droplets. That is, if these droplets meet with the wind, then their journey may be longer. At the same time until these droplets are evaporated by air. Again the importance of masks – This study once proved the usefulness of the mask. That is, if both the healthy person and the infected person have not worn the mask, then there will be no benefit of social distancing. Because even in social distancing, people are able to stand at a distance of more than 4 to 6 feet. In such a situation, we can all understand how important it is for all people to wear masks.

    "body": "2020/07/24 - Earlier studies have shown that cinnamon, a commonly used spice provides many health benefits, including the ability to lower blood sugar and help manage diabetes. Cinnamon contains bioactive components that can help lower blood sugar levels. The incidence of type II diabetes is increasing across the world. Dietary modifications help the patients to control blood sugar. Traditional herbs and spices are commonly used for control of blood sugar among which cinnamon (Ròu Guì; Cinnamomum cassia) has the greatest effect. With increasing number of patients of diabetes, Identifying strategies to prevent the progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes has become challenging, yet it is important to find measures to control blood sugar in patients with Prediabetes or overt diabetes. “Our 12-week study showed beneficial effects of adding cinnamon to the diet on keeping blood sugar levels stable in participants with prediabetes,” said the study’s corresponding author, Giulio R. Romeo, M. D. , of Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, Mass. “These findings provide the rationale for longer and larger studies to address if cinnamon can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes over time. ” The randomized clinical trial investigated the effects of cinnamon supplementation in 51 participants with prediabetes. Participants were given a 500 mg cinnamon capsule or placebo three times a day for 12 weeks. The researchers found that cinnamon supplements lowered abnormal fasting glucose levels and improved the body’s response to eating a meal with carbohydrates, which are hallmarks of prediabetes. Cinnamon was well tolerated and was not associated with specific side effects or adverse events. For further reference log on to: The manuscript, “Influence of Cinnamon on Glycemic Control in Subjects with Prediabetes: A Randomized Controlled Trial,” was published online. "

    "title": "Home made face masks likely need multiple layers to prevent spread of coronavirus study says",
    "body": "2020/07/24 - For sale masks are seen displayed on a clothesline in the front yard of a house in Los Angeles on July 20, 2020. A home-made cloth face mask likely needs two or three layers to be effective in preventing the spread of the coronavirus, according to an observational study published Thursday in the medical journal Thorax. Researchers at the University of New South Wales in Australia looked at the effectiveness of single and double-layer cloth face coverings at reducing the spread of respiratory droplets that pass when an infected person speaks, coughs or sneezes. They then compared those results with that of a three-ply surgical face mask. The researchers used LED lighting and a high-speed camera to film the dispersal of airborne droplets produced by a healthy person with no respiratory infection. The video for speaking was captured at 850 frames per second, while coughing and sneezing was framed 1,000 frames per second due to the higher expulsion speeds, they said. A three-ply surgical face mask was the most effective at reducing airborne droplet dispersal, the researchers found after reviewing the footage. The single-layer covering reduced the droplet spread from speaking, though the double layer covering was better in reducing droplets from coughing and sneezing, according to the researchers. “A cloth face covering with at least two layers is preferable to a single-layer one,” Prateek Bahl, School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, UNSW Sydney, Australia, and a lead author of the study, wrote in the findings. “Guidelines on home-made cloth masks should stipulate multiple layers. ” To be sure, the researchers said a single-layer face covering is better than no face covering at all. Additionally, several other factors determine the efficacy of cloth masks such as type of material, the number of layers, the arrangement of different layers and frequency of washing, they said. The single-layer face covering was made from a folded piece of cotton T-shirt and hair ties. The double-layer covering was made using the sewing method as shown by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The researchers used tissue paper to simulate the mucus membrane of the nasal cavity and induce a sneeze, according to the study. The study comes as the Trump administration pushes for the public to adopt face coverings in an attempt to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The United States has the worst outbreak in the world with 4 million cases and at least 143,820 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. President Donald Trump’s response to the pandemic has also come under increasing scrutiny. In recent weeks, Trump has downplayed the threat of the virus, tying the surge in new cases to an increase in testing. However, public health officials and infectious disease experts dispute those claims, saying the rate of cases that test positive in the U. S. , hospitalizations and deaths remain high in some states. Trump endorsed masks for the first time this week after resisting them for months. The CDC began recommending face masks for the general public in April. Earlier in the day, Adm. Brett Giroir, an assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services, told reporters that 90% of the public or more need to wear face coverings in order to curb the spread of the virus. “If we close the indoor bars, reduce the occupancy of restaurants, have face coverings and hygiene, this is essentially equivalent to shutting down the entire economy, which means shutting down elective surgeries and everything else that goes with that,” he said.

    "body": "2020/07/24 - Professor Sarah Gilbert, who is leading development of a coronavirus vaccine at Oxford University, in Oxford, April 24, 2020. (Mary Turner/The New York Times) Professor Sarah Gilbert, who is leading development of a coronavirus vaccine at Oxford University, in Oxford, April 24, 2020. (Mary Turner/The New York Times) Earlier this week, there was positive news on the Oxford vaccine candidate, one of a clutch of frontrunner candidates to protect the world from the SARS-CoV-2 virus that had, until Friday (July 24) morning, infected nearly 15. 5 million people and killed over 630,000 worldwide. Leading its development is a British scientist who plays the oboe, cycles to work, and is the mother of triplets. Dr Sarah Gilbert was famous in the scientific community as a brilliant vaccinologist; with the success in early trials, she — and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the vaccine candidate her team is working on — has been spotlighted as never before. Gilbert and co-authors published the results of the early trials in the medical journal, The Lancet, on July 20, titled “Safety and immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: a preliminary report of a phase 1/2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial”. They wrote: “ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 showed an acceptable safety profile, and homologous boosting increased antibody responses. ” Which means that the vaccine candidate had induced an immune response (which is what vaccines are supposed to do), and was safe for people.       Don’t miss from Explained   How ‘corona’ of the virus changes into a hairpin shape — and why   What is Dr Gilbert’s work in the field of vaccine development? Dr Gilbert is one of the leading vaccinologists in the world. She is professor of vaccinology at Oxford University’s Jenner Institute, a prestigious vaccine research centre, and one of the two founders of its spin-out company, Vaccitech, which develops immunotherapy products to treat and prevent infectious disease and cancer. For more than 15 years, Dr Gilbert has been making and testing vaccines that trigger T cells — a type of white blood cells — to respond to antigens from malaria, influenza, and tuberculosis, among others. Her work also includes developing vaccines for influenza and emerging diseases such as Lassa, Nipah, CCHF, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). MERS, which appeared in 2014, too, is caused by a coronavirus. “A vaccine against MERS has been tested in clinical trials in the UK, and is now in trials in Saudi Arabia, where the virus is endemic,” says Gilbert’s page on the Jenner Institute website. The vaccine for MERS involved using the adenovirus (which causes common colds) from a chimpanzee embedded with the genetic material of the MERS virus. For the Covid-19 vaccine, the Oxford scientists used the adenovirus of a chimpanzee embedded with the genetic material from the spike protein, which the coronavirus uses to pierce the cell. In tests till now, bodies of participants have responded as if they were infected with the coronavirus. 📣 Express Explained is now on Telegram.

(John Cairns, University of Oxford via AP) What is known about the acclaimed scientist’s life away from her work? Dr Gilbert has not given many interviews since the publication of the results of the early phase trials. Earlier profiles of the scientist in the UK media have said that as a child in Northamptonshire’s Kettering High School for Girls, she was quiet, polite, and studious, getting a lot of ‘A’s in studies. Gilbert belongs to a family of musicians, and her mother, Hazel, was part of the town’s operatic society. By the age of 17, however, Gilbert was sure that she wanted to be a medical researcher. After obtaining a degree in biology at the University of East Anglia and a PhD in biochemistry from the University of Hull, Dr Gilbert worked at a number of biotechnology companies, among them Delta, where she learnt about making medicines. Profiles on Prof Gilbert have noted that she became a vaccine specialist rather by accident. In 1994, when she entered Oxford University to join Professor Adrian Hill’s lab in a senior postdoc position, it was to work on human genetics. “That highlighted the role of a particular type of immune response in protection against malaria, and so the next thing to move on to was to make a vaccine that would work through that type of immune response — and that’s how I got into vaccines,” she told UK’s The Telegraph newspaper in an interview. By 2007, Dr Gilbert, who had become a reader at Oxford University three years previously, had won a project grant from the Wellcome Trust, and had begun work on an influenza vaccine. She has developed two vaccines for the disease so far, and has said that her ultimate aim is to be able to develop her team of scientists to be the leaders in vaccine research in the world.

(John Cairns, University of Oxford via AP) A doctor takes blood samples for use in a coronavirus vaccine trial in Oxford, England, Thursday June 25, 2020. (John Cairns, University of Oxford via AP) Many people are fascinated with Dr Gilbert’s success in balancing the extra demands that women with a career in science face. According to UNESCO, women make up less than 30 per cent of the world’s researchers. In science, technology, engineering and mathematics, women also “publish less, are paid less for their research and do not progress as far as men in their careers”. On the website of the Nuffeld Department of Medicine (of which Jenner Institute, where she works, is a part), Dr Gilbert has been quoted as saying: “Work life balance is very difficult, and impossible to manage unless you have good support. Because I had triplets in 1998, nursery fees would have cost more than my entire income as a post-doctoral scientist, so my partner has had to sacrifice his own career in order to look after our children. ” She described how 18 weeks of paid maternity leave with three premature babies to care for and work to be completed, was tough: “If there is a three-year grant and a woman wants a year-long maternity leave, it can disrupt the progress of the project. The situation becomes worse if more than one person is away simultaneously. ” Dr Gilbert’s advice to women: “One of the good things about being a scientist is that the hours are not fixed, so there is a fair amount of flexibility for working mothers. Having said that, there are also times when things (such as overseas conferences and important meetings) are fixed and you have to make sacrifices. It is exceptionally hard work. It’s important to plan ahead, and make sure you have people who are willing to cover for you at home while you work. That might be your partner or relatives, or you may be able to buy in help. ” Her own children “seem to have survived unscathed, but none of them wants to be scientists”, she said. The big question: Will there be a vaccine this year? Dr Gilbert is cautiously hopeful. In an interview to the BBC, she said, “Nobody can be absolutely sure that it is possible. That’s why we have to do trials. I think the prospects are very good but it is not completely certain. ” 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

    "title": "A Tale Of Three Potential Vaccines How They Stack Up In The Race For Coronavirus Prevention",
    "body": "2020/07/24 - Towards the end of May, Oxford had already made the announcement of phase 2/3 human trials. These phases will involve testing of a much larger group of people and, more importantly, across a wider age group, to include children and elderly people. Trials have already begun in Brazil and South Africa. Testing of 30,000 patients is expected in the US as well. With the vaccine raising hope, the UK, the US, and others including Serum Institute of India (world’s largest vaccine producer by volume) have already entered into commitments with Oxford University and AstraZeneca to have more than 2 billion vaccine doses supplied to them. BNT162 Pfizer announced its five-point plan to battle Covid-19 on 13 March. Chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) Dr Albert Bourla called for collaboration in the fight against the virus and announced that his company was up to the task – “Pfizer is working to advance our own potential antiviral therapies and is engaged with BioNTech on a potential mRNA coronavirus vaccine. ” Three days later, Pfizer and BioNTech made it official that the two companies would jointly develop BioNTech’s mRNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162. This collaboration was natural since both Pfizer and BioNTech had been involved in joint research and development work for a couple of years already to develop mRNA-based vaccines for prevention of influenza. The BNT162 Covid-19 vaccine programme had multiple mRNA candidates. Progress was noted with antiviral activity recorded against SARS-CoV-2 in preclinical screening. By 22 April, the phase 1/2 clinical trial for the vaccine – with its four mRNA candidates – received a nod from the German regulatory authority, the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut. The trial kicked off immediately after that in Germany and, after approvals, a week later in the US. Preliminary data for a sub-group of 45 people arrived on 1 July. In an encouraging development, one of the four vaccine candidates, BNT162b1, was able to stimulate antibody responses at or above the levels observed in Covid-19-recovered plasma patients. Based on this data, the potential vaccines BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 were put on fast track by the US Food and Drug Administration. Preliminary data from the phase 1/2 trial for 60 people in Germany backed up the US data, demonstrating the ability of BNT162b1 to elicit high SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titers. In addition, T cell responses were observed for the first time for any Pfizer-BioNTech candidate. On the back of the good results, both the UK and the US entered into agreements with Pfizer and BioNTech to procure an initial 30 million and 100 million doses of their vaccine respectively after the necessary approvals. As more data trickles in from the phase 1/2 trials, the collaborators get to pick their lead vaccine candidate and decide on the dose level to be administered to a much larger group – possibly involving up to 30,000 volunteers – in succeeding trials, slated to get underway in July. Efforts have been on to ramp up manufacturing capabilities to enhance the production capacity. The Pfizer-BioNTech combine is currently expecting to manufacture “up to 100 million doses by the end of 2020 and potentially more than 1. 3 billion doses by the end of 2021”. mRNA-1273 The American biotechnology company Moderna in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health finalised the sequence for their vaccine candidate mRNA-1273 two days after the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus was made known by China. In an astounding achievement, the company took just 25 days from sequence selection to vaccine manufacture. To draw a comparison, it took 20 months to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus that caused the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002-03 – merely for testing in humans. The pace of vaccine development was quick, but news of funding began to come in quickly too. For instance, in the third week of January, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations was roped in to fund the manufacture of Moderna’s vaccine. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) within the US Department of Health and Human Services came on board with a commitment of up to $483 million to push along the development of the potential vaccine. Later, Moderna also struck a deal with Swiss company Lonza to enable manufacturing of up to one billion shots at the dose level of 50 µg per year. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases conducted the phase 1 trial in the US. On 24 February, the first batch of mRNA-1273 was released for testing. The first of the 45 patients were given a shot on 16 March. Simultaneously, work was underway to manufacture more doses for potential future trials. On 12 May, Moderna received the ‘fast track’ designation from the US FDA for its potential vaccine. Positive preliminary results emerged from phase 1 almost a week later, with the mRNA-1273 eliciting neutralising antibody titer levels in the eight initial participants – four of whom received a 25 µg dose while the other four received a 100 µg dose. The phase 2 study, with 600 healthy volunteers in two age groups of 18-55 years and 55 years and above, got underway towards the end of May. On 14 July, the interim analysis of Moderna’s phase 1 study was published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The early results of the study showed rapid and strong immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 across all dose levels. Moderna has already advanced the late-stage development of its Covid-19 vaccine. Its phase 3 study protocol has been made known too and, according to the company, reviewed by the US FDA. “The randomized, 1:1 placebo-controlled trial is expected to include approximately 30,000 participants at the 100 µg dose level in the U. S,” revealed the company. At 100 µg, Moderna expects to deliver around 500 million doses per year, and “possibly up to 1 billion doses per year, beginning in 2021”, according to the company. Road Ahead The title of a 14 July editorial in The New England Journal of Medicine, “The COVID-19 Vaccine-Development Multiverse”, captures faithfully this exceptionally diverse vaccine work in progress simultaneously across the world. A vaccine usually takes 10 years to develop, according to the UK-based health research foundation Wellcome Trust. In light of this fact, the speed in the case of Covid-19 vaccine is clearly unprecedented, indicating a departure from the old paradigm. "

By Yael Annemiek Engbers, University of Liverpool and Andrew Biggin, University of Liverpool Deep inside the Earth, liquid iron is flowing and generating the Earth’s magnetic field, which protects our atmosphere and satellites against harmful radiation from the sun. This field changes over time, and also behaves differently in different parts of the world. The field can even change polarity completely, with the magnetic north and south poles switching places. This is called a reversal and last happened 780,000 years ago. Between South America and southern Africa, there is an enigmatic magnetic region called the South Atlantic Anomaly, where the field is a lot weaker than we would expect. Weak and unstable fields are thought to precede magnetic reversals, so some have argued this feature may be evidence that we are facing one. Now our new study, published June 12, 2020, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, has uncovered how long the field in the South Atlantic has been acting up – and sheds light on whether it is something to worry about. Weak magnetic fields make us more prone to magnetic storms that have the potential to knock out electronic infrastructure, including power grids. The magnetic field of the South Atlantic Anomaly is already so weak that it can adversely affect satellites and their technology when they fly past it. The strange region is thought to be related to a patch of magnetic field that is pointing a different direction to the rest at the top of the planet’s liquid outer core at a depth of 1,795 miles (2,889 km) within the Earth. This “reverse flux patch” itself has grown over the last 250 years. But we don’t know whether it is simply a one-off product of the chaotic motions of the outer core fluid or rather the latest in a series of anomalies within this particular region over long time frames. If it is a non-recurring feature, then its current location is not significant – it could happen anywhere, perhaps randomly. But if this is the case, the question of whether its increasing size and depth could mark the start of a new reversal remains. If it is the latest in a string of features reoccurring over millions of years, however, then this would make a reversal less likely. But it would require a specific explanation for what was causing the magnetic field to act strangely in this particular place. Volcanic rocks To find out, we travelled to Saint Helena – an island in the middle of the South Atlantic Ocean. This island, where Napoleon was exiled to and eventually died in 1821, is made of volcanic rocks. These originate from two separate volcanoes and were erupted from between eight million and 11. 5 million years ago. When volcanic rocks cool down, small grains of iron-oxide in them get magnetized and therefore save the direction and strength of the Earth’s magnetic field at that time and place. We collected some of those rocks and brought them back to our lab in Liverpool, where we carried out experiments to find out what the magnetic field was like at the time of eruption. Our results showed us that the field at Saint Helena had very different directions throughout the time of eruption, showing us that the field in this region was much less stable than in other places. It therefore challenges the idea that the abnormality has only been around for only a few centuries. Instead, the whole region has likely been unstable on a timescale of millions of years. This implies the current situation is not as rare as some scientists had assumed, making it less likely that it represents the start of a reversal. A window into Earth’s interior So what could explain the odd magnetic region? The liquid outer core that is generating it moves (by convection) at such high speeds that changes can occur on very short, human timescales. The outer core interacts with a layer called the mantle on top of it, which moves far slower. That means the mantle is unlikely to have changed very much in the last ten million years. From seismic waves passing through the Earth, we have some insight into the structure of the mantle. Underneath Africa there is a large feature in the lowermost mantle where the waves move extra slow through the Earth – meaning there’s most likely an unusually warm region of the lowermost mantle. This possibly causes a different interaction with the outer core at that specific location, which could explain the strange behavior of the magnetic field in the South Atlantic. Another aspect of the inside of the Earth is the inner core, which is a solid ball the size of Pluto beneath the outer core. This solid feature is slowly growing, but not at the same rate everywhere. There is a possibility that it is growing faster on one side, causing a flow inside the outer core that is reaching the outer boundary with the rocky mantle just under the Atlantic hemisphere. This may be causing irregular behavior of the magnetic field on the long timescales we found on Saint Helena. Although there are still many questions about the exact cause of the irregular behavior in the South Atlantic, this study shows us that it has been around for millions of years and is most likely a result of geophysical interactions in the Earth’s mysterious interior.

    "body": "2020/07/24 - The best and worst-case scenarios of global warming are unlikely to occur, according to a comprehensive new study on climate probabilities. A prediction of 1. 5-4. 5C warming if atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide are doubled has been the international standard since 1979. But a new study authored by a 25-strong team of international climate scientists over four years suggests it is “extremely unlikely” that warming would stay below 2C above pre-industrial levels, and puts minimum warming at 2. 3C. The likelihood of staying between 1. 5C and 2C is 5 per cent, the authors say. The study maintains the top temperature at 4. 5C, but says some recent predictions that warming above that will be reached are also “unlikely”, with a 6-18 per cent chance. A less cautious analysis by the experts puts likely warming at an even narrower range of 2. 6-3. 9C. A doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is predicted to happen within the next 60-80 years if current emissions are maintained. That timeline will be extended by climate action such as that agreed in the Paris Accord. “One of the most worrying aspects of climate change is that it is very much a roll of the dice,” said Zeke Hausfather, one of the co-authors. “What we’ve found is that the odds of getting a one or a six is a lot less likely than we previously thought. ” The team behind the study have a range of expertise, and used more methods to compile their evidence than any previous study. That included looking at temperature records since the industrial revolution, estimates of prehistoric temperatures, satellite records and climate models. The study is likely to now inform the next assessment by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change next year. "

    "body": "2020/07/23 - It takes about two years for Corning to develop each new generation of Gorilla Glass, the resilient material that graces a critical mass of iPhone and Android devices. That process has for several update cycles focused on protecting screens against drops, fending off shatters and cracks by boosting what’s known as compressive strength. The newly announced Gorilla Glass Victus, though, gives equal weight to preventing scratches. That’s harder than it sounds, and more useful than you’d think. It’s not that Gorilla Glass has dismissed scratches entirely. But the last time Corning prioritized it as a threat was in Gorilla Glass 3, which came out all of seven years ago. Since then, smartphones have gotten much better about bouncing back from sidewalk run-ins, but handle an inadvertent key dig about the same as they did when the iPhone 5S came out. Enter Victus, which promises double the scratch resistance of 2018’s Gorilla Glass 6. It performs better in a drop test too, surviving a 2-meter fall compared to its predecessor’s 1. 6m durability. Scratch That Itch The answer to “why now” is pretty straightforward; customers started asking for it more vocally. But why it became as much of a priority as drop survivability is a more interesting question. “What we think is happening is people are keeping their phones longer,” says John Bayne, who leads Corning’s Gorilla Glass business. “Phones that aren’t breaking in a drop event are coming up with a scratch on it. ” And it’s true: Apple disclosed last year that iPhone customers are upgrading less frequently. If you’re holding onto your phone for three years, that’s more time to pick up nicks and dings along the way, especially if the display survives a fall that a few years ago would have required a full screen replacement. There’s also the fact that making glass that’s both scratch and drop resistant is, well, hard. The manufacture of glass is often a game of compromise, which you can see most clearly in the quest for durable foldable phones: the stronger it is, the less it can bend. In this case, getting those two properties to play nice is less a direct contradiction than it is a process of reinvention. “The glass chemistries that people have been using to improve the compressive stress profiles aren’t necessarily the best for scratch performance,” says John Mauro, a professor of materials science and engineering at Penn State University who had previously spent 18 years at Corning. For Corning, that meant starting Victus almost from … scratch. (Sorry. ) Glass starts with silicon dioxide, but from there it’s open season on the periodic table of elements. “It’s really an infinite palette of options,” says Bayne. “We start with thousands of compositions, and we do a lot of computer monitoring simulation, get down to a couple dozen candidates, do some lab melts, then two or three manufacturing trials to get that ultimate glass. ” The part of that journey that makes glass strong is a so-called ion exchange process, in which potassium ions shove aside smaller sodium ions; think of it like replacing the billiard balls in a rack with slightly larger tennis balls. The rack is suddenly harder to move. For seven years, Corning has been focused on squeezing more tennis balls into that rack. Victus required a different tack. “That whole science for drop, sometimes the moves that you make at the molecular level are a little bit different than you would for scratch,” says Bayne. “Our technologists were really trading off composition elements of the glass and how we ion exchange it to show a meaningful improvement. ” "

    "body": "2020/07/23 - The successful launch of the UAE’s first mission to Mars – which also marks the first Arab space mission to the red planet – is a significant feat that highlights new ambitions in the Arab Gulf. Christened Al-Amal, or Hope, the spacecraft blasted off from Tanegashima Space Center in Japan and will reach Mars by February next year. The objective of the probe is to build the first full picture of Mars’ climate throughout the Martian year. Besides joining the race to Mars – the US and China too are launching their own Mars missions in the coming weeks to take advantage of a window where Earth and its red neighbour are closest – the UAE wants this mission to catalyse growth in its STEM sector. That in turn is part of the wider trend in the Arab Gulf to reorient their oil-dependent economies to focus more on areas such as IT, green energy, AI and the fourth industrial revolution. This creates an ocean of opportunities for India-UAE or even India-Gulf Cooperation Council ties. After all, given India’s prowess in IT and commendable proficiency in space technology – India too has gone to Mars with Mangalyaan – there is much that can be shared in terms of knowledge and human resources. Besides, the UAE is already the No 1 host of Indian migrants, with Indian professionals already well-established in tech and education sectors there. This can be enhanced further if Arab Gulf nations are looking to boost STEM-driven industries. Finally, the pitch for tech self-sufficiency among Arab Gulf nations is driven by a desire to outcompete regional rival Iran. With India-Iran relations hitting a rough patch due to geopolitical complications, India-Arab Gulf cooperation can hit a purple patch, compensating for the former. "

SpaceX’s next crewed mission won’t launch next month after all. Crew-1, which will send four astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, had been tentatively targeted for Aug. 30. But the flight will now lift off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida “no earlier than late September,” agency officials wrote in an update today (July 22). SpaceX still has a crewed mission underway — Demo-2 , a test flight that launched NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley toward the ISS on May 30. Demo-2 is set to wrap up with an Atlantic Ocean splashdown on Aug. 2, weather and wave conditions permitting. Related: SpaceX’s historic Demo-2 crewed test flight in photos Demo-2 was designed to show that SpaceX is ready to begin operational crewed missions to the ISS with Crew Dragon and its Falcon 9 rocket. Elon Musk’s company holds a $2. 6 billion deal with NASA’s Commercial Crew Program to fly at least six such contracted missions, the first of which will be Crew-1. The coming mission will be cleared for liftoff only after a thorough examination of Demo-2 data, SpaceX and NASA officials have said. Crew-1 will carry four spaceflyers to and from the ISS: NASA astronauts Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover and Shannon Walker, and Japan’s Soichi Noguchi. The quartet will spend about six months aboard the orbiting lab, which is the standard ISS stint. Behnken and Hurley, by contrast, are getting just a two-month orbital stay on Demo-2. Boeing holds a NASA commercial crew contract as well, which the company will fulfill using a capsule called CST-100 Starliner. Starliner isn’t ready to fly astronauts yet, however. The spacecraft must first refly an uncrewed test mission to the ISS, after failing to hook up with the orbiting lab as planned during its first attempt this past December. The makeup mission will likely launch later this year, NASA officials have said.

    "body": "2020/07/23 - Earlier this year astronautic launch services provider and equipment manufacturer Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) made history when it launched astronauts from American soil to the International Space Station (ISS) in its Dragon 2 spacecraft atop a Falcon 9 Block 5 liquid rocket booster. The launch was a part of NASA Dragon DM-2 mission which is the final step in the space agency’s testing and evaluation of SpaceX’s vehicle for crewed commercial missions to the ISS under its Commercial Crew Program (CCP). Since the Dragon 2 docked with the space station in May, astronauts on board have been busy evaluating the spacecraft various performance parameters. These cover the Dragon 2’s power generation capabilities, its software and life support system performance and as NASA revealed recently, the vehicle’s habitability. SpaceX Wants FCC To Reject Starlink 12GHz Spectrum Sharing Petition For habitability, NASA has now confirmed that the Dragon 2 has passed all of the space agency’s requirements in a critical step that moves the spacecraft one step forward towards officially ferrying astronauts to the ISS in missions in which NASA is the contractor as opposed to the service provider. SpaceX Crew Dragon 2 Habitability Tests Included Hatch Evaluation, Waste Management &amp; Cargo Storage Onboard the Dragon 2 were NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley and they joined Commander Chris Cassidy of Expedition 63 and Russian cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner. All personnel have been busy in performing spacewalks to replace the station’s aging batteries and the Crew Dragon 2’s habitability evaluation was carried out by Behnken, Hurley, Cassidy and Ivanishin. Part of the testing covered evaluating the spacecraft’s hatch by opening and closing it, the ability of the vehicle to manage onboard waste and its ability to store cargo transported from the ISS. Given that American astronauts will be joined by their international counterparts in the crewed missions, astronauts Hurley and Behnken were joined by cosmonaut Ivanishin and Commander Cassidy to evaluate the Dragon 2’s sleeping configuration’s performance with a crew of four onboard. The Dragon 2 is capable of transporting a crew of seven members to the ISS, but this configuration is yet to be tested. Even as the Dragon 2 spacecraft clears NASA’s habitability tests, Bob, Doug and other crew onboard the ISS still have other tests to run on the vehicle. As confirmed by NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine on social media last week, the space agency intends to bring back the Dragon 2 vehicle currently docked with the ISS to Earth on August 2nd. The spacecraft’s undocking with the ISS, its performance of the required maneuvers for insertion into Earth’s atmosphere, its ability to sustain Behnken and Hurley during their travel back to Earth, its resilience during the strenuous condition of reentry and its ability to allow the astronauts to egress post-launch will all form critical components of the Dragon 2’s remaining evaluation criteria. Once the tests are complete, commercial missions on a different Dragon 2 vehicle will officially commence and with them mark the start of NASA’s plans of growing the scope of the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) economy. The Falcon 9 booster that will propel the Dragon 2 Crew-1 mission the ISS is already under testing in Florida, with the spacecraft for the mission set to arrive soon. "

Now Slack Technologies, whose popular chat and collaboration software has become embedded in the daily routines of millions of workers at thousands of companies, is hoping to change that. Slack said on Wednesday that it had filed a complaint against Microsoft with the European Commission, accusing the tech giant of using its market power to try to crush the upstart rival. Slack claims that Microsoft has illegally tied its collaboration software, Microsoft Teams, to its dominant suite of productivity programs, Microsoft Office, which includes Outlook, Word, Excel and PowerPoint.

    "body": "2020/07/23 - Enlarge Image ESO/G. Lambert Exoplanets, those mysterious planets that dwell outside of our solar system, are always fascinating, but humanity is particularly interested in those located in their stars’ habitable zones where liquid water might exist. A new method for detecting exoplanets could help scientists spot many more of these intriguing, distant worlds. A planet named NGTS-11b is the poster child for this new technique. A team of researchers led by Samuel Gill of the University of Warwick in the UK rediscovered the planet by starting with data from NASA’s planet-hunting TESS telescope. This is a cosmic detective story. TESS first located the planet by seeing a subtle dip in brightness when it crossed in front of its star. But TESS only stares at a section of space for a limited period of time, usually 27 days. Scientists like to observe two dips in brightness to confirm an exoplanet’s existence, but some of those planets take longer than 27 days to circle back around. This is where the Next-Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) telescopes in Chile come into play. NGTS conducted a follow-up observation on the star, which is 620 light-years away, but watched it for 79 nights. The researchers were able to log two dips in brightness, effectively rediscovering NGTS-11b, which travels around its star every 35 days. “These discoveries are rare but important, since they allow us to find longer period planets than other astronomers are finding. Longer period planets are cooler, more like the planets in our own solar system,” Gill said in a release from the University of Warwick on Tuesday. While NGTS-11b has a temperature cooler than Mercury and Venus, Gill said it’s still too hot to support life as we know it. The NGTS work, however, could point the way to more planet discoveries in the “Goldilocks zone,” a whimsical reference to the habitable zone around stars. Other planets found this way may be more hospitable than NGTS-11b. Gill is eyeing the hundreds of single transits spotted by TESS that could become targets for NGTS. “Some of these will be small rocky planets in the Goldilocks zone that are cool enough to host liquid water oceans and potentially extraterrestrial life,” he said. The search is off to a good start. "

    "title": "Planetary Researchers Surprised to Find a Ring of Fire on Venus",
    "body": "2020/07/23 - ETH researchers used computer simulations to classify the current activity of corona structures on the surface of Venus. To their surprise, they found a previously undiscovered ring of fire on our neighboring planet. Years ago, planetary researchers discovered unusual circular structures on the surface of Venus when observing high-​resolution images from NASA’s Magellan mission. Such structures are known as coronae (from the Latin meaning “crowns”; singular: corona). A few years ago, a team of ETH researchers led by Taras Gerya, Professor of Geophysics at the Department of Earth Sciences, used computer models to investigate how these structures may have formed. Most researchers assume that these odd circular surface features are formed by mantle plumes from deep within the planet. A mantle plume is an upwelling of hot, molten rock that is transported by convection currents from the lower mantle to the crust in a column that widens in a mushroom-​shape at the top. The heat it carries melts the surface of the crust in a circular form. Continuous material rising from greater depths widens the plume head and expands the ring structure on the surface to form a corona. The solid crust surrounding the mantle plume may crack and ultimately sink below the edge of the corona, triggering local tectonic processes. Computer simulations of structural variations of coronae However, the topography of coronae is by no means homogeneous or easy to describe. “These structures exist in a large variety of shapes and dimensions on the Venusian surface,” says Anna Gülcher, a doctoral student in Gerya’s research group. Following up on this observation, Gülcher used a larger set of improved 3D simulations to re-​examine the coronae as she sought to establish a link between the variation in surface topography and the processes at work beneath. Her study was recently published in the journal Nature Geoscience. The new simulations show that a corona’s topography depends on the thickness and strength of the crust where the mantle plume strikes it and, above all, that their topographies are directly related to how active the column of magma beneath the surface is. It is important to note, however, that the position and dynamics of Earth’s ring of fire are the result of plate tectonics, she explains. On Venus, the cause is vertical hotspot volcanism—a phenomenon that occurs in only a few places on Earth, such as below the Hawaiian Islands. Exactly why the mantle plumes on Venus are arranged in such a belt, and what this means for deep interior processes on Venus, is an important question to address in future studies, Gülcher says. This may be done with large-​scale computer simulations. Huge computing capacity required In their models, the researchers simulate only the very top few hundred kilometers of the mantle plume. In reality, however, the plume conduits could be over 1,000 kilometers long: “Simulating the total length the plumes could reach is out of the question because of the huge computing capacity it would require,” Gülcher says. The current simulations, performed using the Euler cluster at ETH, are already eight times larger than previous ones. The planetary scientists hope that their findings will also provide fresh insights into how mantle plumes function below the surface of the Earth. They are likely to be what causes hotspot volcanism, as seen in the Hawaiian Islands. Mantle plumes may have been a trigger for plate tectonics observed on Earth as well, as Gerya’s research group was also able to simulate. As mentioned at the time, Venus could serve as a model for the processes that may have taken place in Earth’s early history. Active plumes form a ring of fire around Venus This salient observation enabled Gülcher and her colleagues to classify over a hundred of large coronae on Venus into two main groups: those that have formed above an active plume that is currently rising and carrying molten material, and those above a plume that has cooled and become inactive. “Every corona structure has a specific signature that indicates what is going on beneath it,” Gülcher says. On a map of Venus, she plotted all the coronae according to how their activity was classified. To her surprise, most of the coronae overlying active mantle plumes form a belt in Venus’ southern hemisphere. Only a handful of active plumes are located outside this band. “We called this band the ‘Ring of Fire’ on Venus in reference to the ‘Ring of Fire’ on Earth,” Gülcher says. She assumes that the belt coincides with a zone that expels high levels of rising plume material. For more on this research, read Scientists Identify 37 Active Volcanoes on Venus. ### Reference: “Corona structures driven by plume–lithosphere interactions and evidence for ongoing plume activity on Venus” by Anna J.

WinFuture has published the specs, just as it did for the bigger upcoming Note. The most significant downgrade is definitely the screen. The regular Galaxy Note 20 will have a 6. 7-inch, 1080p display that tops out at a very traditional refresh rate of 60Hz. (The Note 20 Ultra is believed to have an enormous 6. 9-inch 3200 x 1440 display that runs at 120Hz like the Galaxy S20. ) On the plus side, images make clear that the Note 20 has a flatter display than the Ultra’s somewhat curved edges. Samsung is also reserving the 108-megapixel camera for its flagship Note 20 Ultra, opting for a 12MP wide, 12MP ultrawide, and 64MP portrait / telephoto trio on the back of the Note 20 that allow for 8K video recording and 30x zoom. (The Ultra is rumored to get up to 50x zoom capabilities. ) Even the S Pen is held back a bit on the regular Note 20, with a 26-millisecond response rate for Samsung’s stylus compared to the newly improved, near-instant 9ms on the Ultra model. The standard Note 20 will have a 4,300mAh battery with reverse wireless charging, 256GB of storage (there’s no microSD support for this one), and 8GB of RAM. It might have the same processor as the larger Ultra, but you can definitely see where Samsung decided to give the Ultra an advantage. "

The reasoning is a little complicated, so bear with us. 9to5Mac is basing its hunch on iOS’s Display Zoom feature, which you can use to make your phone’s text, buttons, and icons bigger. Display Zoom works by pretending your phone has a smaller physical display, so if you’re using an iPhone 11 Pro Max with a 6. 5-inch screen, Display Zoom shows the interface designed for the 5. 8-inch display of the iPhone 11 Pro, essentially magnifying the elements. Corroborating previous reports from Ming-Chi Kuo 9to5Mac discovered a new smaller resolution in iOS 14 beta 3 that enables Display Zoom for the iPhone X, XS, or 11 Pro for the first time. The display resolution of 960 x 2079 pixels scales back to fit nicely inside an iPhone with a 5. 4-inch display, leading 9to5Mac to speculate that Apple could have a phone with this screen size on the way. It’s not that much to go on, but the sleuthing has the backing of a number of predictions from Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. In June last year, Kuo predicted that we’d see a 5. 4-inch iPhone with 5G support and an OLED display in 2020, and earlier this year he said that the phone is due to go into mass production in September.

Coleman went with radishes because these bad boys vegetate rather quickly. This is important because on the moon, days and nights last 14 Earth days each. Coleman also said, “They have been used before in space, and they germinate very, very fast,” in the press release. After the COVID-19 breakout, Coleman and his team of 12 had to postpone on-site tests of the sensors planned for moon mission use. The team now works remotely from home, during one of their video meetings Coleman pondered how they could vegetate radishes on the moon. He had the idea of doing some tests with no nutrient soil and soil with a small amount of nutrients. After some discussion, Coleman went “Let’s not theorize about this; why don’t we just do it!” and ordered radish seeds along with desert sand, which is closest you can get to no-nutrient on Earth. The idea is to handle feeding the astronauts with as little material as possible. “We want to do one tiny step in that direction, to show that lunar soil contains stuff which can be extracted from it as nutrients for plants,” Coleman said, and added, “this includes getting the right chemical elements to allow plants to make chlorophyll and grow cell walls. ” Radishes are renowned for their little water need, still, to Coleman’s surprise the less he watered them the more successful radishes were. Of course, the properties of the moon are a tad bit different from Earth, Coleman concluded; “We can’t properly test here on Earth with perfect lunar soil, but we’re doing as much here as we can. Then we want to show that it actually does work on the Moon. ” "

    "title": "How to See Comet Neowise Before It s Gone",
    "body": "2020/07/23 - In late March, a team of astronomers working on a space telescope mission called Neowise discovered a comet booking it past the sun, 160 million miles away from Earth. The comet, officially known as C/2020 F3 but usually just referred to as Neowise, is a 3-mile-wide chunk of ice and dust on a 6,000-year loop around the solar system. It’s just one of thousands of space rocks discovered with the Neowise telescope, but its trajectory means that for a few weeks this summer it will give observers in the northern hemisphere a rare cosmic light show. “This is the most impressive-looking comet that I have seen since the 1990s with Hale-Bopp,” says George Hripcsak, an amateur astronomer in New York City. Hale-Bopp is a comet on a 2,500-year orbit around the sun that made its closest pass by Earth in 1997. It was visible to the naked eye for a year and a half, and famously inspired the mass suicide of the Heaven’s Gate cult. (Although comet Neowise isn’t quite as bright as Hale-Bopp was, it also doesn’t appear to have prompted any human sacrifices. ) The best time to catch a glimpse of Neowise was in early July, just after it made its closest approach to the sun and reached peak brightness. The comet has grown noticeably dimmer over the past few days as it moves away from the sun, but if you haven’t had a chance to check it out yet, it’s not too late. Neowise makes its closest approach to the Earth on Thursday, and if you live in the northern hemisphere you’ll still be able to see it with your naked eye for a few more days. We asked amateur astronomers for their best tips on how to go comet-spotting. What to Look For Like all comets, Neowise consists of a dense nucleus made of ice, dust, and ionized gas that form a brilliant double tail as they blow off the comet. The Neowise tail is huge; it covers as much sky as if you were to place 12 full moons side by side. “Seeing a tail that long doesn’t happen very often,” says Hripcsak. When to See Comet Neowise If you want to spot the comet, the best time to go stargazing is about an hour after sunset. Depending on where you live, this will probably be around 10 pm. The comet will be visible for about an hour or so before it drops below the horizon. “It needs to be dark enough for you to be able to pick out the entire Big Dipper, not just the handle,” says Katherine Troche, an amateur astronomer in New York City. “If you can get away from the streetlights, your visibility will improve, but you may still need binoculars as the comet will become less bright over the next few weeks. ” How to Spot the Comet Comet Neowise is visible from anywhere in the northern hemisphere. But the night sky is a pretty big space to search, so amateur and professional astronomers have built a number of apps to help you find celestial objects, including the comet, based on your location. If you want to stargaze like the pros, there’s SkySafari 6 for iOS and Android phones, but it’ll set you back $20. Free apps include Celestron’s SkyPortal. "

    "title": "How Much Will the Planet Warm if Carbon Dioxide Levels Double ",
    "body": "2020/07/23 - How much, exactly, will greenhouse gases heat the planet? For more than 40 years, scientists have expressed the answer as a range of possible temperature increases, between 1. 5 and 4. 5 degrees Celsius, that will result from carbon dioxide levels doubling from preindustrial times. Now, a team of researchers has sharply narrowed the range of temperatures, tightening it to between 2. 6 and 4. 1 degrees Celsius. Steven Sherwood, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, and an author of the new report said that the group’s research suggested that these temperature shifts, which are referred to as “climate sensitivity” because they reflect how sensitive the planet is to rising carbon dioxide levels, are now unlikely below the low end of the range. The research also suggests that the “alarmingly high sensitivities” of 5 degrees Celsius or higher are less likely, though they are “not impossible,” Dr. Sherwood said. What remains, however, is still an array of effects that mean worldwide disaster if emissions are not sharply reduced in coming years. Masahiro Watanabe, a professor in the atmosphere and ocean research institute at the University of Tokyo and an author of the report, said that determining an accurate range of temperatures was critically important for international efforts to address global warming, like the Paris climate agreement, and for mitigating the effects of climate change.

    "title": "Discovering how genetic dark matter plays a role in mental illness is just the tip of the iceberg for human health",
    "body": "2020/07/23 - Each cell in our bodies holds two metres of DNA that contains the six billion bits of the DNA code necessary for making a healthy human body. This is known as the human genome. It is now accepted that what makes people different, and contributes to their susceptibility to ill health, are the 6-10 million DNA differences in the human genome known to exist within the general population. A surprising fact is that only 1. 7% of these 6 billion bits of code represent the genes that make proteins. Proteins are the physical building blocks of our bodies and are essential to keep us healthy. Though huge strides have been made in mapping the DNA differences associated with mental health conditions such as depression, schizophrenia and chronic anxiety thanks to the sequencing of the human genome, what surprised many was the discovery that over 98% of these DNA changes lay within the dark and mysterious remainder of the human genome that did not make protein. This part of the genome had been largely dismissed as the “junk” genome but, because of its importance to health, is now known as “the non-coding genome”. Critically, we don’t yet fully understand what type of information is contained in the non-coding genome that is so essential for human health and how DNA differences change this information result in ill-health. Useful junk To understand how the non-coding genome supports health it may be helpful to think of the human body as a vast and extremely complex community of different cells. Which means the identity of a cell, and its ability to communicate effectively with other cells, is essential for normal human development and health. Based on this assumption, many scientists have suggested that although genes contain the information to make cells, the information required to allow these cells to communicate and organise into tissues resides in the non-coding genome. Incredibly, recent estimates suggest that the human non-coding genome contains over five times more information critical to health than that which is contained within genes. We now know that much of the information in the non-coding genome is in the form of “gene switch” sequences (also known as promoters and enhancers) that control the levels that genes are turned on in specific cells and in response to specific signals. It is highly likely that these switches, by responding to signals travelling between cells, are responsible for coordinating the cell-to-cell interactions required to form the structure and function of organs such as the brain. However, identifying these switches and their function in specific cells has been challenging. Being able to easily identify and understand these gene switches, and the effects of ill-health-inducing DNA differences on their activity, will be critical to fully understanding the genetic basis of mental health. Alcohol and anxiety It has been known for some time that a number of genes are responsible for regulating behaviours such as alcohol intake and mood. Disappointingly, analysis of these genes in the human population has failed to identify changes in the DNA of these genes that were strongly associated with disorders such as alcohol abuse and chronic anxiety. Working in collaboration with Andrew McIntosh at the University of Edinburgh, our research looked to determine what controlled the very specific expression of neuropeptides (chemical signals) in parts of the brain where they are essential to controlling normal mood and alcohol intake. We noticed that the specific cell types in which many of these genes were switched on were shared by many different species. For example, the gene that produces the alcohol intake and mood-controlling galanin peptide was turned on in very specific regions of the hypothalamus and amygdala – parts of the brain that control appetite and mood in mice, rats and humans. We reasoned that the sequences of the gene switches that controlled this expression would also be very similar between these species. So we used powerful computers that lined up the DNA sequences of more than 100 vertebrate species and found that a non-protein-coding DNA sequence, next to the galanin gene, had changed very little through evolution, suggesting its importance for survival. Using CRISPR genome editing, a process that allows us to make targeted deletions in the DNA of mice, we deleted this sequence from the mouse genome and found that the galanin gene was switched off in these mice. Surprisingly, we also found that mice lacking this switch drank less ethanol and that male mice had reduced fear. The most important observation was that the switch contained DNA differences in the human population that altered its activity. Our research showed that one of the differences could be linked to alcohol abuse and anxiety in men in the UK Biobank human genetic cohort which mirrored our observations in mice. This study was recently published in the academic journal Molecular Psychiatry. We believe that our ability to quickly and accurately identify the functional components of the non-coding human genome, and how they can go wrong to contribute to susceptibility to mental health conditions, is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of human health. Which means the same principles used in our studies can be applied for other diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes and susceptibility to Covid-19. There is even evidence that the activity of these gene switches can be affected by life events such as childhood deprivation known to affect disease susceptibility through an epigenetic process known as DNA-methylation – epigenetics being the study of biological mechanisms that switch genes on and off. There has never been a more exciting time to be in genetics and it is hoped that the exploration of the “dark matter” of the non-coding genome will bring tremendous benefits in terms of being able to diagnose susceptibilities to mental health disorders and other conditions and help us develop new, more personalised treatments.

China did not announce the launch date or time in advance, but a notice to mariners warned of an impending flight and sure enough, the Long March 5 roared to life and streaked away from the Wenchang Satellite Launch Center on Hainan Island southwest of Hong Kong at 12:41 a. m. EDT (12:41 p. m. local time). China Xinhua News announced the launch a few minutes later on Twitter.

Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine tweeted his best wishes to China: With today’s launch, China is on its way to join the community of international scientific explorers at Mars. The United States, Europe, Russia, India, and soon the UAE will welcome you to Mars to embark on an exciting year of scientific discovery. Safe travels Tianwen-1! — Jim Bridenstine (@JimBridenstine) July 23, 2020 The flight comes on the heels of the successful launch of a United Arab Emirates Mars orbiter, called Hope, from Japan on Sunday. Next up will be the launch of NASA’s $2. 4 billion Perseverance Mars rover from Cape Canaveral on July 30. All three missions are taking advantage of a relatively short Mars launch opportunity that comes around once every 26 months when Earth and Mars are in favorable positions to permit direct flights by existing rockets. All three spacecraft are expected to reach their target next February. NASA’s Perseverance rover got its name from a Virginia seventh grader who won a NASA contest open to school kids across the nation. Hope refers to the UAE’s drive to develop a high-tech “knowledge-based” economy while inspiring the youth of the Middle East to pursue careers in math and science. Tianwen-1’s name comes from an ancient Chinese poem and means, appropriately enough, “questions to heaven. ” If all goes well, the 11,000-pound Tianwen-1 spacecraft will brake into orbit around Mars next February. A Long March 5 rocket blasts off from the Wenchang Satellite Launch Center on Hainan Island Thursday carrying China’s Mars-bound Tianwen-1 spacecraft on July 23, 2020. China Xinhua News The orbiter is equipped with seven instruments, including high- and medium-resolution cameras; a ground-penetrating radar; a mineralogy spectrometer; a magnetometer; and two charged particle detectors. Its planned orbit around the martian poles will carry it within about 165 miles of the surface and as far away as 7,450 miles. After mapping the world below for several months, the orbiter will release a landing craft that will descend to a rocket-powered touchdown on a broad, 2,000-mile-wide plain known as Utopia Planitia, the same general region where NASA’s Viking 1 lander touched down in 1976. The 530-pound six-wheel rover will ride down atop the lander and then roll off extendable ramps to the surface. The rover is equipped with six instruments, including a multi-spectral camera, a terrain camera, a ground-penetrating radar, magnetic field detector, meteorology sensors and others. The rover is designed to receive commands and beam back data to Earth using the Tianwen-1 orbiter as a relay station. “A successful landing would put China among elite company,” Mason Peck, an aerospace engineer at Cornell University, told the journal Science. An artist’s impression of the Tianwen-1 lander and rover on the surface of Mars. China Global Television Network China has successfully sent two rovers to the moon, including one that landed on the never-before-visited far side. An attempt to send an orbiter to Mars in 2011, hitchhiking on a Russian rocket, ended in failure when the Zenit booster malfunctioned. The all-Chinese Tianwen-1 mission is the nation’s most ambitious attempt yet at interplanetary exploration. “Tianwen-1 is going to orbit, land and release a rover all on the very first try, and coordinate observations with an orbiter,” mission managers wrote in the journal Nature Astronomy. “No planetary missions have ever been implemented in this way. If successful, it would signify a major technical breakthrough. ” The solar-powered rover is designed to operate for at least 90 days while the design life of the orbiter is a full martian year, the equivalent of two Earth years. NASA has successfully landed eight spacecraft on the martian surface: two Vikings in 1976; the Mars Pathfinder rover in 1997; the twin Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, in 2004; the stationary Phoenix lander in 2008; the nuclear-powered Curiosity rover in 2012; and the stationary InSight lander in 2018. InSight and Curiosity are still operational, as are three NASA orbiters. Perseverance, which is a near twin of Curiosity and four times heavier than its Chinese cousin, is the most advanced rover of them all. It is equipped with state-of-the-art cameras and instruments to search for signs of past or even present microbial life. It also will deploy a small experimental helicopter — a first on Mars — and collect rock and soil samples for eventual return to Earth by a joint NASA-European Space Agency mission at the end of the decade. The Chinese say they’re also planning a Mars sample return mission around 2030. "

    "body": "2020/07/23 - On this day in 1969, Americans Neil Armstrong and Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the moon. They were the first of a select group of Americans to be the only humans to do so. Fast forward to more recent times: in May, the world saw America return to launching American’s to space with the SpaceX launch to the International Space Station. Now, in just ten days, NASA will launch its Perseverance rover to Mars, the latest in a fleet of American vehicles on the red planet. The historic anniversary of Apollo 11 and NASA current activities remind us of both America’s dominant history as well as its current dynamism in space. Under NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine’s strong leadership, NASA’s long-awaited Commercial Crew Program (CCP) has come to fruition with the May 30 launch of two NASA astronauts to the station and subsequent successful docking—signifying America’s return to putting people into space under its own flag, and not relying on the services of others—especially countries like Russia that are strategic competitors. Moreover, this return occurs with an embrace of the dynamism of the free market. NASA is getting out of the business of putting astronauts and material into low-Earth orbit. Not only can NASA buy these services at competitive market rates from American firms, stimulating a new sector of the U. S. economy, it can now focus on its greater national priority—expanding U. S. access to deeper space—the Moon, Mars, and beyond. This represents the next generational leap for NASA—Apollo took Americans to the moon, and the space shuttle cemented American leadership in building the International Space Station—but NASA was stuck in low-earth orbit. By transitioning the earth to orbit taxi/freight business to American commercial launchers, it can now take Americans to the Moon, Mars and beyond. This major shift in NASA’s operations gets lost in media commentary, coming at the same time that China’s space program has made great strides. Chinese announcements come frequently—plans for Chinese landers, Chinese crew on the Moon, new Chinese space launchers, Chinese plans for a space station, and an upcoming Chinese launch to Mars. It all sounds impressive—but let’s remember, as NASA has learned, it is easier to announce plans than it is to accomplish them. In considering most of China’s ambitious plans, it’s worth noting that NASA’s already done all of that—most of it decades ago. China on the moon? Let’s look back forty years—NASA put Americans on the Moon in six crewed missions between 1969 and 1972; and is sending Americans back by 2024, with a sustained American presence on the moon through the Artemis program by 2028. Overall, more than fifty missions to the Moon have failed, including recently by an Israeli company. While talking about the Moon is easy, getting to the Moon is hard. China plans for space launch? Setting aside its long history, America has revolutionized space launch in recent years through both commercial and government launchers, with SpaceX (and others working on it) re-taking the low-earth orbit launch market and building the world’s current heaviest launcher, the Falcon Heavy, and NASA building the Space Launch System which will be the heaviest still when it launches with a third more lift capability in 2021. A Chinese space station? Over twenty years, NASA evolved the U. S. space station Freedom into a U. S. -led international coalition for the $100 billion International Space Station with Russia, Japan, Canada and eleven members of the European Space Agency. The United States shouldered over half of the overall cost of building it, including thirty-six space shuttle missions. It has been continuously manned for almost twenty years (it will be twenty years in November 2020)—with 151 Americans (three times more than the next highest nation, Russia with about fifty). A Chinese Mars mission? NASA has had eight successful Mars landers/rovers (Viking I/II, Pathfinder, Spirit/Opportunity, Phoenix, Curiosity and InSight) and launched at least six successful Mars orbiters, including some which have returned exquisite science about the planet—the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) includes the HiRISE (The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment at the University of Arizona—the powerful HIRISE camera takes pictures that cover vast areas of Martian terrain while being able to see features as small as a kitchen table. Only two nations—the United States and the former USSR—have successfully landed a spacecraft on Mars (and the Soviet lander, Mars 3, failed twenty seconds after landing), and only four have successfully put spacecraft in orbit: the United States, the former USSR, European Space Agency and India. More than twenty-eight missions to Mars have failed—and China will try again this year, after having last tried to reach Mars in 2011. Since then, with three rovers (Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity) and one planned for launch in July (Perseverance), Mars has been an American frontier. Getting to Mars is hard, too. NASA runs the most comprehensive space exploration program of the solar system, with more missions than the rest of Earth combined. For a quick survey of the solar system, NASA’s Mariner 10 and MESSENGER spacecraft are the only missions to have explored Mercury but the European Space Agency’s BepiColumbo is on its way. The United States and USSR both sent missions to explore Venus in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, followed by the European Space Agency and Japan in the 2000s. Mars has largely been an American frontier not only for its rovers but for its orbiters as well, including the Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Mars Orbiter Mission, and MAVEN. America collaborative projects, Mars Express and Trace Gas Orbiter, have been successful too. Others are launching to Mars this year, with the UAE, India, and China sending missions that could join the Americans there. The only ten missions to Jupiter and Saturn have been U. S. missions, although some required the participation of the European Space Agency, and America is the only nation to send missions to Uranus and Neptune (Voyager 2) and Pluto (New Horizons). As China is making new developments in space, NASA’s dominance in that region makes it the envy of the planet. In addition to its impressive history, NASA is currently running more than eighty-five active missions to explore the solar system, the Commercial Crew Program is now coming to fruition, it is returning Americans to the moon, and developing the hardware go to Mars. This is happening in addition to NASA’s contributions to the U. S. economy, and to education in America, both of which help make the case for continued investment in NASA and to maintain NASA’s lead over China and other strategic competitors. As China continues its progress, Americans need to remember their country’s historical, current and future dominance in space. This context is important for recalling, especially when it comes to China, that it is easier to plan a mission than it is to achieve the mission’s end goal.

ASUS says that it’s also vastly upgraded the heat sink of the SoC inside the phone, with it now being 6x larger than that found on the ROG Phone II. Combined with a revamped vapour chamber design, the new phone is said to be virtually immune to thermal throttling and is able to keep is peak performance figures for prolonged periods even in demanding situations. The phone also upgrades its RAM and storage options. You’re able to feature up to 16GB of LPDDR5 memory, whilst the 512GB NAND storage has been upgraded to an UFS 3. 1 unit, improving transfer speeds by up to 15%. On the display side, ASUS has kept the same screen size and resolution as on the ROG Phone II at 6. 59” and 2340 x 1080, but this time around has upped the already high 120Hz refresh rate to up to 144Hz, with also an uptick in the input touch sampling rate to up to 270Hz. This being the biggest feature of the ROG Phone II, it’s arguably seen smaller upgrades this generation. ASUS is seemingly also keeping a very similar footprint between generations as both phones still have 171 x 78mm length and widths, although the new phone is listed as being thicker at now up to 9. 85mm. Weight hasn’t changed and still falls in at a hefty 240g, mostly taken up by the huge 6000mAh battery that also hasn’t seen changes this generation. Much like its predecessor, these are gigantic phones. On the camera side of things, we’ve seen a big improvement on the main camera unit which has been switched from the previous generation IMX586 sensor to a newer IMX686. The upgrade here lies in its larger 1/1. 72” sensor size, retaining 0. 8µm pixels but being improved in resolution to up to 64MP with a quad-Bayer colour filter array, binning down to 16MP for regular mode shots. As of writing we don’t have information on the optics of the camera. The ultra-wide-angle seems to have at surface remained the same at 13MP with a 125° field of view, but again we’re lacking specifics. An addition to the camera array is a 5MP macro camera which generally is more of a gimmick rather than something that augments the capture experience. In terms of connectivity, of course the big upgrade is the move to 5G thanks to the new X55 modem. Wi-Fi 6 also the norm now and BT has been upgraded to version 5. 1. We don’t see mention of ASUS’ “wireless display” functionality with 802. 11ad so it might be the company has removed this feature this generation. One other big feature that’s been removed is the 3. 5mm headphone jack. Unfortunately, as in many other vendors this has gone the way of the Dodo, and is only otherwise available through ASUS’ AeroActive Cooler 3 add-on accessory which features a pass-through USB-C and 3. 5mm port. Availability in Europe later this month, the US in September The ROG Phone III is said to first appear in Europe later this month in the form of a Strix variant with a regular Snapdragon 865 and 8+256GB of RAM for 799€, whilst the 12+512GB and 16+512GB variants will be offered later for 999€ and 1099€. In the US, the phone will only release in September with pricing there being released at a later date. Related Reading: "

    "title": "5 reasons OnePlus Nord beats the iPhone SE",
    "body": "2020/07/23 - The OnePlus Nord is generating a lot of buzz because of how much phone OnePlus crammed in for such a low price. The iPhone SE has a similar appeal, but OnePlus and Apple take different approaches to their cheapest phones. And when you take a hard look at what you’re getting for the money, the Nord looks like the better value Yes, the iPhone SE ($399) has the faster A13 Bionic processor, but when you look at other areas like screen size, design, the number of cameras and 5G capability, you can see why the OnePlus Nord (£379, under $500) starts to pull away. Here’s why the OnePlus Nord is a better value than the iPhone SE. A bigger and better screen The OnePlus Nord has a 6. 4-inch display. (Image credit: Tom’s Guide) Although some people may prefer the tiny 4. 7-inch LCD on the iPhone SE, the OnePlus Nord’s 6. 4-inch OLED panel is bigger and more colorful. OLEDs are technically superior to LCDs in terms of color saturation, black levels and viewing angles. If you’re into watching Netflix shows or playing games, the Nord is a no-brainer. The iPhone SE sports a 4. 7-inch screen. (Image credit: Tom’s Guide) Plus, the Nord offers a 90Hz refresh rate, compared to 60Hz for the iPhone SE. This means you should enjoy smoother scrolling, video playback and gaming on the OnePlus Nord. The Nord also wins on screen resolution, packing 2400 x 1080 pixels compared to just 1334 x 750 for the iPhone SE. A design that looks like it’s from 2020 You won’t find chunky bezels on the OnePlus Nord. (Image credit: Tom’s Guide) The iPhone SE’s design has some things going for it, including water resistance and premium looking glass back. However, the OnePlus Nord actually looks like a phone from this year, with minimal bezels around its display. By comparison the bezels on the iPhone SE look ginormous, including the chin that houses Apple’s Touch ID sensor. The OnePlus Nord integrates its fingerprint sensor directly into the display. The OnePlus Nord wins on color options, too. While the iPhone SE comes in ho-hum hues like white, black and red, the Nord has more interesting options in Blue Marble and Gray Onyx. More versatile cameras The OnePlus Nord houses four rear cameras. (Image credit: Tom’s Guide) Apple proved with the iPhone SE (just like the Pixel 3a did before it) that you can deliver excellent photos with a single rear camera. And that’s because of the computational photography magic provided by Apple’s A13 Bionic chip. It allows the iPhone SE to pull off Portrait Mode and Smart HDR without needing a second lens. A OnePlus Nord photo sample in Nightscape mode. (Image credit: OnePlus) However, it’s hard to overlook the versatility of the OnePlus Nord. The handset packs four rear cameras, including a 48MP wide camera, an 8MP ultra-wide lens, a 5MP depth sensor and even a 2MP macro lens. That gives you a lot of shooting options the iPhone SE can’t match. Plus, the Nord offers a Nightscape mode for low-light shots while the iPhone SE lacks a Night mode. The OnePlus Nord also looks to be a better option for selfies, thanks to a 32MP camera up front paired with an ultra-wide camera with a 105-degree field of view. This should let you fit more people into your shots. The iPhone SE makes due with a 7MP selfie cam. 5G speed vs 4G (Image credit: OnePlus) Granted, 5G is far from ubiquitous around the world. but even if you’re buying a cheaper phone you probably prefer that it’s as future proof as possible. After all, you’re probably going to hold onto the phone for at least a couple of years. That’s why it’s good to know that the Snapdragon 765G chipset in the OnePlus Nord support 5G connectivity. That way you can enjoy faster downloads wherever there’s coverage — and if 5G is not in your neck of the woods yet you’ll be ready for when it is. The iPhone SE will forever be stuck in the 4G LTE lane. Bigger battery and faster charging The OnePlus Nord offers 20W fast charging standard. (Image credit: OnePlus) Apple’s iPhone SE reportedly packs a 1,821 mAh battery, which didn’t deliver great results in our web surfing battery test. The handset lasted only 9 hours and 18 minutes, while the handsets on our best phone battery life list all last over 11 hours on a charge. The OnePlus Nord should offer more saying power with its much larger 4,115 mAh battery, but it also needs to power a much bigger display than the iPhone SE. What we do know for sure is that the OnePlus Nord charges faster than the iPhone SE out of the box. And that’s because the OnePlus Nord includes a 30W fast charger, while Apple forces you to pay extra for a 18W charger. Bottom line The iPhone SE is one of the best cheap phones of the year because it delivers flagship-level performance for hundreds less than flagship phones, along with very good camera quality. But the OnePlus Nord looks like an even better value because you get a bigger and smoother screen, 5G connectivity a much more modern design and more versatile cameras. The biggest strike against the OnePlus Nord is that the company currently does not plan to bring the handset to the U. S. But overall, the OnePlus Nord looks to be a superior mid-range phone to Apple’s handset. "
