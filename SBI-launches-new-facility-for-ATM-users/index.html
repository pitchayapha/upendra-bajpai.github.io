    "body": "2020/09/03 - BHAGALPUR : “Every person you meet is a potential carrier of the disease,” a doctor said to me when I visited the town of Bhagalpur and its nearby villages to cover the raging coronavirus pandemic in India’s countryside. Dr. Kumar Gaurav, a psychiatrist who conveyed that warning, was put in charge of the main hospital in Bhagalpur after the epidemic struck down some of his colleagues and others refused the job. Infections in India now total over 3. 5 million, rising from two million in just over three weeks - the third highest number of coronavirus infections in the world. The disease is rampant in rural India, where people often have to rely on the most basic health facilities. We wanted to show the human toll of the disease in the countryside, home to two-thirds of India’s 1. 3 billion people. So, I headed out to one of the country’s most poverty-stricken regions – Bihar state in eastern India. The area I went to was not easy to reach. Wary of the risk of infection from using public transport, I and a driver travelled for four days by car across India’s northern plains from New Delhi, through floods and along rutted roads. We carried full personal protection suits, masks, goggles and sanitisers – which was far more than hospital staff I encountered had. In Bhagalpur, I found patients and their families desperate for help and medical staff struggling with a shortage of manpower and equipment that left them at risk of infection. Often, even the equipment they did have did not work. Gaurav’s hospital was dedicated to treating patients with COVID-19, serving a population of about 10 million people, and it still received other patients. Most COVID-19 patients came in with relatives, who accompanied them to the intensive care wards. After trying to care of the sick – sitting with them, massaging and feeding them, these relatives would go home for the night. Gaurav said the healthcare system was close to breaking point. One of the points of constant strain, he said, was trying to limit the visits from relatives to patients in the ICU given the risk that they could spread the infection. That underlined his warning to me that everyone I meet could be carrying the disease - it wasn’t a casual comment. The town was under a strict lockdown, but most of the residents were not wearing masks or following any social distancing rules. Traffic was frenetic. After four days in Bihar, we were on the road back to New Delhi. Gaurav remained behind, the last doctor standing in his hospital on the banks of the Ganges River. When we saw him, he was making the rounds with armed guards to try to enforce rules in the hospital. He told me he felt compelled to step up to take charge. “A lot of my colleagues refused,” he said. “I had to take up the responsibility. ” Subscribe to newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.

The pandemic is not only ravaging the health of the people around the globe, but it has also cornered us and distanced us from our normal lives. For the last eight months, people have majorly relied on virtual gatherings, video calls and socially distanced visits in the most extreme scenarios. However, as the lockdown restrictions are slowly being lifted in countries across the world in a bid to save the economy from nose-diving, people are beginning to step out of their houses to meet their friends and family members.

    "body": "2020/09/03 - Bengaluru: Doctors here claim to have developed a new test to examine specific ‘T’ cell immunity for COVID-19. Said to be India’s first-ever test to assess specific ‘T’ cell immune responses to stimulation by SARS CoV-2 proteins, it could help to better triage patients and set a framework for a sensible vaccination programme, TimesNow quoted doctors as saying. The doctors who jointly developed the test, said they are in the process of applying for a patent for this assay, the report added. How does ‘T’ cell immunity work? COVID-19 affects people in different ways (mild to severe) and immunity plays an important role in the body’s response to the infection. It is now understood that apart from antibody response, a strong ‘T’ cell response can help in giving protective immunity. Antibody tests “Antibody responses are not produced by all patients who contract COVID-19 and do not persist beyond 8 weeks in most people. The use of serological tests alone for screening will underestimate the number of people who have specific viral immunity. This test could complement serological surveys and provide a better picture of the prevalence of the disease and residual immunity,” said the report. “We have devised a novel, simple, in-tube assay for the assessment of specific T cell immune responses to stimulation by SARS CoV-2 proteins. Traditional tests for T cell immunity require complex processing to separate different cells from blood samples and use technology that is not readily available. This test can be done with a small sample of whole blood. Our solution simplifies the testing process which can be done at smaller labs without specialised equipment. The blood doesn’t require any special treatment. The results can be obtained in 24 hours, by measuring chemicals called cytokines. A positive reading indicates good specific cellular immunity,” Dr Sonal Asthana and Dr Vishnu Kurpad, two doctors involved in making the test were quoted as saying in a press release. "

    "body": "2020/09/03 - The Joint Task Force of public health experts on Monday, August 31, wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, stating that the vaccine for the contagious COVID-19 “would not be available in near future. ” The experts added that the focus should be on preventing deaths and not containing the virus. The statement issued by the experts of the Indian Public Health Association, the Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine and the Indian Association of Epidemiologists said, “While being optimistic, the prevention and control strategy should also prepare for the worst. Vaccines do not have any role in current ongoing coronavirus pandemic control in India. ” “It must be assumed that an effective vaccine would not be available in the near future. We must avoid a false sense of hope that this panacea is just around the corner,” it added. The petitioners of the joint statement include the former and present professors of All India Institute for Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Jawaharlal Nehru University, and Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research along with former advisors to the Ministry of Health. The experts stated that the pandemic is a global health issue and should be handled with “empathy and meaningful community engagement. ” “We strongly and unequivocally advocate for a public health approach for the novel coronavirus pandemic control, with the maximum possible good being done for the largest possible numbers,” they added. “Vaccines with proven efficacy and safety, as and when available, should be administered according to the WHO’s ‘strategic allocation’ approach or a multi-tiered risk-based approach,” the statement further said. The experts also suggested stopping the ongoing practice of blocking residences of individuals who have tested positive. They further proposed the plan of resuming educational institutions in a graded manner. “Lockdown as a strategy for control should be discontinued,” the statement said. “Cluster restrictions should be considered only in areas with no community transmission. Even cluster restrictions should be imposed after weighing the impact of the same on the livelihood of the target population,” it added. The experts further said that the system of placing the inter-state travelers under quarantine should be stopped and instead, effective strategies like home isolation measures should be followed. They also listed out some action plans that can be considered by the government to curb the spread of the virus. Meanwhile, COVID-19 cases continue to rise with India becoming the first country in the world to report 80,000 active cases in a single day. The country also witnessed a surge in fatality rates with 28,859 deaths recorded in August which is a 50 per cent rise from the past month’s record.

    "body": "2020/09/03 - Quantum communication is rapidly gaining popularity due to its high security and technological maturity. However, most implementations are limited to just two communicating parties (users). Quantum communication networks aim to connect a multitude of users. Quantum communication networks present a revolutionary step in the field of quantum communication. Scientists at the University of Bristol have created a unique prototype understood to be the largest-ever quantum network of its kind. It could secure people’s online communication, particularly in these internet-led times, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The prototype has been developed using a technique that controls the laws of physics. The method makes messages completely safe from interception while also overcoming significant challenges. Lead author Dr. Siddarth Joshi, who headed the project at the university’s Quantum Engineering Technology (QET) Labs, said: “This represents a massive breakthrough and makes the quantum internet a much more realistic proposition. Until now, building a quantum network has entailed huge cost, time, and resource and often compromises on its security, which defeats the whole purpose. ” “Our solution is scalable, relatively cheap, and, most important of all, impregnable. That means it’s an exciting game-changer and paves the way for much more rapid development and widespread rollout of this technology. ” The group’s quantum technique applies a magical principle, called entanglement, which Albert Einstein depicted as ‘creepy action at a distance. ’ It exploits the power of two distinct particles placed in separate locations, possibly a large number of miles apart, to emulate one another simultaneously. This process presents far more prominent open doors for quantum computers, sensors, and information processing. Dr. Joshi said, “Instead of having to replicate the whole communication system, this latest methodology, called multiplexing, splits the light particles, emitted by a single system so that they can be received by multiple users efficiently. ” Using just eight receiver boxes, scientists created a network for eight users. As the user numbers grow, the logistics become increasingly unviable – for instance, 100 users would take 9,900 receiver boxes. Scientists connected receiver boxes at different locations using optical fibers. The aim was to determine its functionality across the distance. Scientists tested the ability to transmit messages via quantum communication. Despite being completely secure, the technique can move quickly and easily without requiring maximum hardware. It also features traffic management, delivering better network control, which allows, for instance, individual users to be prioritized with a faster connection. The research received funding from the Quantum Communications Hubs of the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC), Ministry of Science and Education (MSE) of Croatia, and the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG). Collaborating institutions with the University of Bristol are the University of Leeds, Croatia’s Ruder Boskovic Institute (RBI) in Zagreb, Austria’s Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information (IQOQI) in Vienna, and China’s National University of Defence Technology (NUDT) in Changsha.

    "body": "2020/09/03 - NASA is looking for leaders for one of the best jobs on Earth for human spaceflight – including missions to the Moon – the position of flight director in mission control at the agency’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. NASA will accept applications for new flight directors Thursday, Sept. 3, through Thursday, Sept. 10. U. S. citizens can apply at: http://www. usajobs. gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/577699400 Those chosen as NASA flight directors will lead human spaceflight missions to the International Space Station, as American astronauts once again are launching on American rockets and spacecraft from American soil to the orbiting laboratory. For almost 20 years, humans have lived and worked continuously aboard the station, advancing scientific knowledge and demonstrating new technologies, making research breakthroughs not possible on Earth that will enable long-duration human and robotic exploration into deep space. Flight directors also will lead upcoming Artemis missions to the Moon, and eventually the first human missions to Mars. Flight directors are responsible for leading teams of flight controllers, research and engineering experts, and support personnel around the world, and making the real-time decisions critical to keeping NASA astronauts safe in space. “NASA flight directors need a unique mixture of confidence and humility, innovation and organization,” said Holly Ridings, chief flight director at Johnson. “The situations you have to deal with are occasionally very tough, and the stakes are always very high. But if you are able to handle that responsibility, there is nothing like knowing that you played a key role in the historic work that NASA does on a day-to-day basis. ” To be considered, flight director candidates must be U. S. citizens with a bachelor’s degree from an accredited institution in engineering, biological science, physical science, computer science, or mathematics. They also will need substantial related, progressively responsible professional experience, including time-critical decision-making experience in high-stress, high-risk environments. Many flight directors have previously been NASA flight controllers, though it is not a prerequisite to apply. NASA will announce selections later this fall. The new flight directors then will receive extensive training on flight control and spacecraft systems, as well as operational leadership and risk management. "

    "title": "Scientists study if meteorite impacts help create life on Earth and beyond",
    "body": "2020/09/03 - A new study, posits that impact craters should absolutely be considered by space agencies like NASA and ESA as top exploration targets, not just for their invaluable post-impact geological records, but also – and perhaps more importantly – as prime locations for seeking potential habitats for extraterrestrial life. The study has been published today in Astrobiology. “There are a lot of hypotheses for where life started on Earth and where we should look for life on Mars, but we are actually overlooking a major geological force and a key habitat in understanding the origin of life and that’s meteorite impacts and their resulting craters,” said Osinski, Director of Western’s Institute for Earth and Space Exploration (Western Space). Leading an international team with investigators from the University of Edinburgh, Georgetown University, and the University of Southern California, this new study is grounded in Osinski’s extensive fieldwork and laboratory studies of meteorite impacts over the past two decades. “If you ask anyone to imagine what happens when you have kilometre-size chunks of rock hitting the Earth, it’s typically destructive. It’s an extinction event like the one that killed the dinosaurs,” said Osinski. “What we’re trying to do here is turn that idea upon its head and say yes, the impact is initially destructive, but it also delivers the building blocks for life and creates new habitats for life. They [impact craters] essentially create an oasis for life,” added Osinski. Osinski and collaborators propose that given the pervasive nature of impact events and their increased frequency during the first 500 million years of Solar System history that meteorite impact craters may represent the most likely sites where life originated on Earth. Unfortunately, says Osinski, we’ll never really know. “I put my money on meteorite impacts as the place where life could have originated on Earth, but we’ll never know,” said Osinski, also Professor in Western’s Department of Earth Sciences. “Unfortunately, due to billions of years of erosion, plate tectonics, and volcanism, we’ve lost the vast majority of the ancient rock record on Earth. So we’re never going to know exactly where or even when, to be honest, life originated on Earth,” added Osinski. But maybe it’s not too late for the Red Planet. By exploring Mars with rovers like Perseverance and ExoMars, Osinski believes planetary scientists might eventually figure out the origin of life – and they just might – as long as they are looking in the right place. “There are other impact craters on Mars that may have been better to explore with these ideas in mind. But Perseverance is going to land in Jezero Crater and there is evidence of minerals such as clays formed through hydrothermal activity,” said Osinski. “It’s a good place to start to explore the role of meteorite impacts in the origin of life, as long as they look out for the habitats, nutrients, and building blocks for life that we outlined in our study,” added said Osinski. To date, 200 impact craters have been investigated and confirmed on Earth using fieldwork, geophysics, satellite data, and various laboratory analysis techniques in pioneering laboratories at Western and others around the world. Osinski and his team have collected and posted relevant data for all 200 craters as part of Western’s Impact Earth initiative. (ANI) "

The SpaceX CEO shared progress on the firm’s Starship rocket during the virtual Humans to Mars Summit, saying the craft ‘is making progresses,’ but also raised concerns about building a base on the planet. Musk has had his heart set on colonizing Mars for years and has not been shy about how he plans to make it happen. The key to turning this dream into a reality will be SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket, which is has been undergoing tests and construction at the firm’s Boca Chica facility in Texas. Based on his projections, SpaceX would need to build 1,000 rockets over a nine-year period in order to take one million people to Mars. ‘We’re making good progress,’ Musk said, as reported on by CNBC. Musk suggested constructing a self-sustaining city will be ‘difficult’ and there will be a number of dangers settlers may face while developing the galactic civilization. ‘I want to emphasize, this is a very hard and dangerous and difficult thing,’ Musk said. ‘Not for the faint of heart. Good chance you’ll die’ The key to turning this dream into a reality will be SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket, which is has been undergoing tests and construction at the firm’s Boca Chica facility in Texas ‘The thing that really impedes progress on Starship is the production system. ’ ‘A year ago there was nothing there and now we’ve got quite a lot of production capability. So we’re rapidly making more and more ships. ’ SpaceX has ramped up productions at Boca Chica in a bid to get the Starship off the ground. The firm conducted the first ‘hop’ of the rocket last month, which saw the vehicle soar nearly 500 feet in the air and land safely back on the ground. Musk unveiled the first Starship prototype in 2019, with the main objective of sending humans to Mars. The CEO had hoped the rocket would be soaring in low orbit by March of this year and have people inside by the end of 2020. However, the Starship program has seen a number of bumps since 2019, which Musk touched on in the Monday interview. SpaceX has ramped up productions at Boca Chica (pictured) in a bid to get the Starship off the ground ‘A year ago there was nothing there and now we’ve got quite a lot of production capability. So we’re rapidly making more and more ships,’ said Musk ‘I hope we do a lot of flights,’ Musk said. ‘The first ones might not work. This is uncharted territory. ‘Nobody has ever made a fully reusable orbital rocket. So just having that at all is pretty significant. ’ Although there has been numerous setbacks, Musk is now aiming for the rocket’s first orbital test flight in 2021. The team is gearing up to add the nose to the rocket, which will being the rocket to around 164 feet tall, and is set to begin construction of the first Super Heavy booster prototype ‘this week. ’ The Super Heavy is the large bottom half of Starship rocket, which has most of the engines and is used during the beginning of a launch.

He said on Monday that engineers have tweaked the design of the Super Heavy booster by increasing the thrust of its Raptor engines, allowing SpaceX to remove several Raptors from the design. ‘So it might be 28 engines,’ Musk said. ‘That’s still a lot of engines. We’ll also end up cranking up the thrust on the engines. ’ An outer ring of engines on the Super Heavy booster will have fixed nozzles, while an inner group of eight Raptors will vector their thrust to steer the rocket during takeoff and landing.

    "body": "2020/09/03 - In a landmark achievement in Space missions, a team of scientists from Pune’s Inter-University Centre for Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics (IUCAA) have discovered one of the farthest galaxies in the universe, officials said here on Tuesday. The galaxy, called AUDFs01 was discovered by a team of astronomers led by IUCAA’s Kanak Saha, announced Union Minister of State Department of Space Jitendra Singh. The galaxy was discovered by India’s first Multi-Wavelength Space Observatory ‘AstroSat’, which detected extreme-UV light from a galaxy located at an astronomical distance of 9. 30 billion light-years from Earth. This is the second achievement for Maharashtra in the past fortnight and comes after two students of IIT-Bombay discovered a SUV-sized asteroid that zoomed past just 2,950 km above Earth’s surface on August 16. The students are Kunal Deshmukh from Pune and Kritti Sharma from Panchkula, Haryana. The importance and uniqueness of this original discovery can be made out from the fact that it has been reported in the leading international journal Nature Astronomy published from Britain. India’s AstroSat/UVIT was able to achieve this unique feat because the background noise in the UVIT detector is much less than one on the Hubble Space Telescope of US based NASA. Singh lauded India’s Space Scientists for once again proving to the world that India’s capability in Space technology has risen to a distinguished level from where our scientists are now offering cues and giving leads to the Space scientists in other parts of the world. IUCAA Director Somak Ray Chaudhury said: “This discovery is a very important clue to how the dark ages of the Universe ended and there was light in the Universe. We need to know when this started, but it has been very hard to find the earliest sources of light. ” A noteworthy aspect is that AstroSat, which made this discovery, was launched by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) on September 28, 2015 during the first term of the Modi government. It was developed by a team led by Shyam Tandon, Ex Emeritus Professor, IUCAA with the full support of ISRO. According to Tandon, the excellent spatial resolution and high sensitivity is a tribute to the hard work of the UVIT core team of scientists for over a decade. "

    "body": "2020/09/03 - tech2 News Staff An international team of astronomers detected extreme-Ultraviolet (UV) light originating from a galaxy called AUDFs01 that is 9. 3 billion light-years away from Earth. There are three subdivisions of ultraviolet radiation: near-ultraviolet (NUV), middle ultraviolet (MUV), far-ultraviolet (FUV), and extreme ultraviolet (EUV). The team that made this discovery includes scientists from India, Switzerland, France, The USA, Japan and The Netherlands and is being led by Dr Kanak Saha, Associate Professor at the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune. The galaxy AUDFs01 is located in the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (XDF). The XDF was assembled by combining 10 years of photographs captured of a patch of sky at the centre of the original Hubble Ultra Deep Field by the Hubble Telescope. Since EUV can only be observed from space, the team made use of the Indian Space Research Organisation’s AstroSat to detect it pouring out of the galaxy. AstroSat is India’s first mission that focuses solely on astronomy and is a multi-wavelength satellite. At any given point, it has five X-ray and ultraviolet telescopes working in tandem. It was first launched in 2015 and is supposed to have a mission life of five years. Using one of the six payloads onboard the satellite, the UVIT- the observation showed that the galaxy AUDFs01 is the first example of a galaxy with clumpy morphology and leaking ionizing radiation. Dr Somak Raychaudhury, Director of IUCAA, said in a statement “This is a very important clue to how the dark ages of the Universe ended and there was light in the Universe. We need to know when this started, but it has been very hard to find the earliest sources of light. ” According to a report by The Print, after the team made this observation, they analysed the data for two years to ensure they had made no mistakes since the Hubble telescope had not been able to detect it. They wanted to be certain that the emission was indeed originating from the AUDFs01. “AstroSat/UVIT was able to achieve this unique feat because the background noise in the UVIT detector is much less than the ones on Hubble Space Telescope”, said Saha in a statement released by ISRO. “We knew it would be an uphill task to convince the international community that UVIT has recorded extreme-UV emission from this galaxy when more powerful HST has not,” he added. The results of this study have been published in the journal Nature Astronomy. NASA congratulates researchers on their exciting discovery.

    "title": "Bizarre Discovery Reveals The Moon Is Rusting Even Without Liquid Water And Oxygen",
    "body": "2020/09/03 - The Moon, our closest cosmic neighbour, and the only other body in the Solar System on which humans have set foot, is fairly well known to us. We know that there is practically no air. We know that there is water ice, but no liquid water. So you can understand why the detection of haematite on the Moon has scientists baffled, since haematite is an oxidised form of iron that, here on Earth, requires the presence of both air and water to form. Especially since the Moon is constantly bombarded with a stream of hydrogen from the solar wind, a reducing agent that ‘donates’ its electrons to the materials it interacts with. Oxidisation occurs due to a loss of electrons - so even if all of the right elements were present for oxidisation to occur, the solar wind should cancel it out. “It’s very puzzling,” said planetary scientist Shuai Li of the University of Hawaii at Manoa. “The Moon is a terrible environment for haematite to form in. ” Enhanced map of the haematite at the lunar north pole. (Shuai Li) The haematite in question was discovered in data collected by the Indian Space Research Organisation’s Chandrayaan-1 orbiter. The Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) designed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory uses hyperspectral imaging to perform a granular spectroscopic analysis, giving a detailed breakdown of the Moon’s surface mineral composition. In this way, Li and his colleagues identified ice deposits at high latitudes around the lunar poles in 2018. But, when he was examining the data, Li noticed something strange. “When I examined the M3 data at the polar regions, I found some spectral features and patterns are different from those we see at the lower latitudes or the Apollo samples,” Li said. “I was curious whether it is possible that there are water-rock reactions on the Moon. After months of investigation, I figured out I was seeing the signature of haematite. ” Which raised a big question: how the heck did it get there? Well, a big hint could lie in how the haematite is distributed. It corresponds pretty strongly with traces of water previously identified and linked to impacts. Scientists believe that water ice could be mixed in with the lunar regolith, and excavated and melted during impact events. The haematite is also mostly found on the side of the Moon that is always facing Earth. That, according to the researchers, is really interesting. “More hematite on the lunar nearside suggested that it may be related to Earth,” Li said. “This reminded me of a discovery by the Japanese Kaguya mission that oxygen from Earth’s upper atmosphere can be blown to the lunar surface by solar wind when the Moon is in Earth’s magnetotail. So, Earth’s atmospheric oxygen could be the major oxidant to produce haematite. ” During the full Moon, our satellite is in Earth’s magnetotail, the trailing region of the magnetosphere away from the Sun. At these times, over 99 percent of the solar wind is blocked from reaching the Moon, which means that pesky hydrogen reducing agent isn’t getting all up in the oxidation process. Combine these three ingredients - minute amounts of molecular water, minute amounts of oxygen, and a brief window of time each month in which rust can form freely - and, over a few billion years, you can get haematite on the Moon. That doesn’t mean the mystery is completely solved, however. “Interestingly, haematite is not absolutely absent from the far-side of the Moon where Earth’s oxygen may have never reached, although much fewer exposures were seen,” Li said. “The tiny amount of water observed at lunar high latitudes may have been substantially involved in the haematite formation process on the lunar far-side, which has important implications for interpreting the observed haematite on some water poor S-type asteroids. ” Getting our hands on the mineral itself would be really interesting. It’s possible that haematite deposits over a range of ages could still retain oxygen isotopes from different ages in Earth’s history, dating back billions of years. This could be really useful for understanding our planet’s atmospheric evolution. And, of course, it would be deeply enlightening for understanding the Moon’s history, too. “This discovery will reshape our knowledge about the Moon’s polar regions,” Li said. “Earth may have played an important role on the evolution of the Moon’s surface. ” The research has been published in Science Advances.

    "title": " Biggest Since Big Bang Scientists Detect Signal from Violent Collision of Two Black Holes",
    "body": "2020/09/03 - Black holes are getting stranger even to astronomers. They’ve now detected the signal from a long-ago violent collision of two black holes that created a new one of a size that had never been seen before. “It’s the biggest bang since the Big Bang observed by humanity,” said Caltech physicist Alan Weinstein, who was part of the discovery team. Black holes are compact regions of space so densely packed that not even light can escape. Until now, astronomers only had observed them in two general sizes. There are “small” ones called stellar black holes that are formed when a star collapses and is about the size of small cities. And there are supermassive black holes that are millions, maybe billions, of times more massive than our sun and around which entire galaxies revolve. According to astronomers’ calculations, anything in between didn’t quite make sense, because stars that grew too big before the collapse would essentially consume themselves, leaving no black holes. Star collapses couldn’t create stellar black holes much bigger than 70 times the mass of our sun, scientists thought, according to physicist Nelson Christensen, research director of the French National Centre for Scientific Research. Then in May 2019 two detectors picked up a signal that turned out to be the energy from two stellar black holes — each large for a stellar black hole — crashing into each other. One was 66 times the mass of our sun and the other a husky 85 times the mass of the sun. The end result: The first-ever discovered intermediate black hole, at 142 times the mass of the sun. Lost in the collision was an enormous amount of energy in the form of a gravitational wave, a ripple in space that travels at the speed of light. It was that wave that physicists in the United States and Europe, using detectors called LIGO and Virgo, captured last year. After deciphering the signal and checking their work, scientists published the results Wednesday in Physical Review Letters and Astrophysical Journal Letters. Because the detectors allow scientists to pick up the gravitational waves as audio signals, scientists actually heard the collision. For all the violence and drama, the signal lasted only one-tenth of a second. “It just sounds like a thud,” Weinstein said. “It really doesn’t sound like much on a speaker. ” This crash happened about 7 billion years ago when the universe was about half its current age but is only being detected now because it is incredibly far away. Black hole collisions have been observed before, but the black holes involved were smaller, to begin with and even after the merger didn’t grow beyond the size of typical stellar black holes. Scientists still don’t know how supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies formed, Christensen said, but this new discovery may offer a clue. Perhaps, like playing Legos, smaller blocks combine to make bigger ones and those combine to make even bigger ones, said Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb, who wasn’t part of the study but said the results chart new astronomical territory. And indeed the bigger of the two black holes involved in this crash could have been the result of an earlier merger, both Weinstein and Christensen said, further bolstering that theory. “It’s conceivable that this pair of black holes formed entirely differently, possibly in a dense system with lots of dead stars whizzing about, which allows one black hole to capture another during a flyby,” said Barnard College astronomer Janna Levin, who wasn’t part of the research and is author of the book “Black Hole Survival Guide. ” On the other hand, scientists can’t quite explain how merged black holes, flying around the universe, would meet so many others to merge again and grow ever bigger. It could instead be that supermassive black holes were formed in the immediate aftermath of the Big Bang. “In astrophysics we’re always faced with surprises,” Weinstein said "

    "title": "Early Human Bedding More Than 200 000 Years Old Found in South Africa",
    "body": "2020/08/18 - Decades after primatologists reported that chimpanzees fashion comfortable nests to sleep in, researchers report on what looks like bedding over 200,000 years old made by early modern humans, suitably positioned for peaceful slumber in the rear of a South African cave. There have been reports of postulated ancient bedding before, including in Israel, but this is the oldest so far. The cave is high on a cliffside in the Lebombo Mountains on the border with eSwatini (formerly known as Swaziland), and is fittingly known as Border Cave. The postulated bedding was made of broad-leafed grasses (since fossilized) that were layered with ash, an international team reported in Science last week. Wondrously, Border Cave was occupied – albeit intermittently – for 226,000 years, until our modern time, the team estimates: from about 227,000 years ago to 1000 C. E. Hearths and the postulated bedding were found throughout the Border Cave’s sequence until 35,000 years ago, reports the paper by Lyn Wadley of the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, with colleagues from the CNRS of the University of Bordeaux and Côte d’Azur University in France, the Higher Institute of Social Studies, Tucumán, Argentina, and the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage, Belgium. Calling the mineralized, layered pile of leaves and ash “bedding” is an interpretation, but a plausible one if we consider that apes also recognize the advantages of comfort and build nests, as opposed to wedging themselves into a tree fork. Birds make nests too, among other animals, but they’re not our relatives. Open gallery view The entrance to Border Cave Credit: A. Kruger Open gallery view Border Cave in Lebombo Mountains Credit: A. Kruger Who lived in Border Cave? Homo sapiens, says Prof. Wadley, the principal researcher and lead author, based on the human remains, including the burial of a baby, albeit from a later time – about 74 000 years ago – and also the remains of five adults over 66,000 years ago. The baby’s is one of the earliest known cases of modern human burial in Africa; it is also one of the earliest known cases of burial with grave goods of a sort: shells. “Homo sapiens originated in Africa at least 300,000 years ago – so 227,000 years ago is Homo sapiens. We do know that Homo naledi was also in Africa at the same time but it hasn’t been found outside central South Africa, and naledi hasn’t been found with any cultural artifacts,” Wadley tells Haaretz. There’s no question that the piled layers of ash and grass that built up over more than 200,000 years were deliberate manufacture, as it were, not the labor of some strangely obsessive animal. The pile is at the back of the cave with the hearth in front, which would have protected the sleepers from the wind and predators – always a good thing. Smoking in bed Why would the early humans of Border Cave have systematically placed the broad-leaved grasses above a layer of ash? First of all, this ash seems to have come from deliberately burning stinky old bedding and from the nearby cave hearth. It’s true that at least sometimes the beds may have burned by accident because of their proximity to the hearth. But the team thinks that accidental conflagration was rare because most of the reeds they found were desiccated, not burned. Now, why might the ancients have deliberately layered their grasses with ash? “We speculate that laying grass bedding on ash was a deliberate strategy, not only to create a dirt-free, insulated base for the bedding, but also to repel crawling insects,” Wadley explains. No question about it, fine ash dehydrates and suffocates ticks and other bugs crawling through it. The team postulates that the Border Cave denizens may knowingly have burned older bedding “to clean the cave and destroy pests. ” Open gallery view Excavating in Border Cave Credit: D. Stratford The findings also imply that the cave inhabitants had control of fire. Indications of fire exploitation go back at least 780,000 years in Israel, a million years in South Africa and possibly as much as 1. 5 million years in Kenya, though those are believed to be remnants of serendipitous “fire harvesting” – helping oneself to a burning bush ignited by lightning, for instance. From possibly 400,000 years ago and in the present case, the archaeologists believe hominins – and later, the Border Cave dwellers – could initiate fire. Or as we laypeople would say, ignite it. In fact, Wadley believes the Border Cave bedding with its layers of insect-repellant ash is a forerunner of more complex utilization of fire that archaeologists have identified at the famed Blombos Cave dating to about 70,000 years ago, and a few other early human sites in South Africa: namely, heating rocks before knapping them into stone tools. It’s significantly easier to knock flakes off a heated rock, Wadley points out. This practice has not been identified beyond South Africa, it bears adding. Working in comfort Could this bedding have served another purpose? It did, in fact: the grass matting was apparently not only used to sleep on comfortably, but also to work on. Within the mineralized grasses and ash, the archaeologists also found debris from the manufacture of stone tools, as well as bits of ocher. The colorful ocher could have been used to decorate their bodies or the tools – both are known in African prehistory going back at least 300,000 years. It makes perfect sense. If you have a choice of parking your tush on a hard floor or a cushion while laboriously fashioning your stone tools, which would you choose? The ocher found in the bedding isn’t like the ocher found naturally in the cave, supporting the assumption that it had been brought in, whether on the body or on tools, the team explains. Wadley shares that the team discussed what to call this pile of grasses: bedding or matting. However, matting implies weaving, and woven, these grasses were not. Floor matting in Misliya Cave? The second oldest-known plant bedding, in South Africa’s Sibudu Cave, has been dated to 77,000 years ago. There is, however, tentative evidence of bedding-like plant layering from about 185,000 years ago in Israel – in the Misliya Cave on the slopes of Mount Carmel. That work, by researchers from the University of Haifa and the Weizmann Institute of Science, was published in 2012 in the journal of the Paleoanthropology Society. Like Border Cave, at Misliya too the remains date to the Early Middle Paleolithic. The evidence indicates that Misliya was intensely occupied through to the Middle Paleolithic – from roughly 250,000 to 160,000 years ago. Today it seems like a rock shelter, but the archaeological exploration elucidated that it’s a large collapsed cavern, which contained tools, charred vegetal matter and animal bones with hallmarks of human consumption – and some bones of humans. A jawbone dated to between 177,000 and 194,000 years ago was found in Misliya in 2002, which seems to belong to Homo sapiens and upset the paradigm about the timeline of Homo sapiens’ evolution and exit from Africa. Open gallery view Misliya Cave in Israel, which may contain 185,000-year-old bedding Credit: Mina Weinstein Evron/ Haifa Univ The point, however, is that the Misliya team led by Mina Evron also found partially charred matter in the center of the cave that they identified as wood ash, burnt bones and plant tissue. It could have been a mat, or bedding, they suggest, noting similarities to the postulated prehistoric bedding found at Sibudu and in Spain’s El Esquilleu Cave. Interestingly, while the bedding in South Africa and Misliya seems to have been the product of early modern humans, the Spanish example of a repetitively existing bedding zone is associated with Neanderthals. So, if apes and hominins made beds, how surprising is it actually to find that early humans did too? Putting aside the almost miraculous discovery of organic material that old, it’s not a huge surprise, says Prof. Dani Nadel of the University of Haifa, who wasn’t associated with the South African research. Wadley agrees: “I think we will find it all over the world, wherever the organic preservation is good enough. It’s not a surprise to us,” she says. And so far, it happened to be good enough in a handful of sites in South Africa, Spain, and possibly in Israel too. "

Having launched from the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan on July 20, the Mars Hope probe will make a further seven TCMs during its 493 million kilometer journey to the red planet. In order to meet planetary protection protocols, Mars and other planetary missions are typically launched on an initial flight path intended to “miss” the planetary target until tests have confirmed the spacecraft is performing correctly, mitigating the chance of a crash on the planet’s surface and subsequent potential contamination with Earth-originating pathogens. The Mars Hope probe’s MOI is scheduled to take place early in February 2021. Mission organizers hope the probe can build the first full picture of Mars’ climate throughout the Martian year. The Emirates Mars Mission (EMM), the first interplanetary mission undertaken by an Arab nation, has announced the successful completion of TCM1 – its first trajectory correction maneuver. (Emirates News Agency) Hope’s mission is focused on atmospheric dynamics, exploring Mars while sampling both diurnal (daily) and seasonal timescales, which has never been done during previous Mars missions. For the first time, scientists based at over 200 universities and research institutes globally will have access to a holistic view of the Martian atmosphere at different times of the day, through different seasons. Weighing more than 1,300 kilograms and roughly the size of a small SUV, Hope is a fully autonomous spacecraft, carrying three instruments to measure Mars’ atmosphere. It was designed and developed by engineers at the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Center, who worked with academic partners, including LASP at the University of Colorado, Boulder; Arizona State University and the University of California, Berkeley.

    "body": "2020/08/18 - For several years, humans have wondered and speculated about the vast quantities of precious metals that are lying unmined in space. According to scientists, there may be billions of dollars worth of precious substances such as gold, platinum, diamond buried deep in asteroids, and pieces of space debris. And now, humans seem to be getting a step closer to mining some of those riches. NASA’s latest mission called Psyche which has been created to study a metal-rock asteroid called ‘16 Psyche’ recently passed its “critical design” phase. The 226-kilometre wide asteroid is situated in the solar system’s asteroid bed between Mars and Jupiter. Why is this particular asteroid of interest to scientists? The asteroid could contain potential riches that can beat the total cost of the entire world’s global economy. According to experts, the asteroid is made up entirely of nickel and metallic iron with a solid gold core. The estimated value of the asteroid can be close to $10,000 quadrillion. That’s enough to make every person on Earth a millionaire. NASA, however, stated that the new device is intended to study ‘16 Psyche’ to find out more about Earth’s formation. “Since we can’t examine Earth’s core up-close, exploring the asteroid Psyche (about 140 miles, or 226 kilometers, wide) could give valuable insight into how our own planet and others formed,” NASA had previously said in July. To achieve the same, the space agency has designed the ‘Psyche’ spacecraft, which will study the asteroid’s magnetic field as well as capture images and data regarding the topography and composition of the asteroid. As per previous reports, NASA had roped in Elon Musk’s SpaceX to collaborate on the mission. If all goes well, the NASA/SpaceX mission may be ready to embark on its voyage to the asteroid by 2022. "

    "body": "2020/08/18 - Earth’s weird magnetic “dent” is on the move – Here’s why that’s serious A mysterious “dent” in Earth’s magnetic field could pose a new threat to satellites and even future space missions, NASA has warned, as the anomaly expands and shifts. Although known to scientists for years now, the South Atlantic Anomaly, or SAA, has more recently been displaying unexpected changes. Earth’s magnetic field is primarily shaped by its north and south poles. They represent opposing magnetic polarities, and so a field of invisible lines run between them, encircling the planet like a cage. However the movement of molten metals in the outer core has an impact on that invisible field. ” These churning metals act like a massive generator, called the geodynamo, creating electric currents that produce the magnetic field,” NASA explains. “As the core motion changes over time, due to complex geodynamic conditions within the core and at the boundary with the solid mantle up above, the magnetic field fluctuates in space and time too. ” One impact of this fluctuation is the gradual drift of the magnetic poles themselves. Much less known, though, is the SAA. There, the weaker forces in the field allow charged particles from the Sun to come closer to the surface. Indeed, they can be powerful enough to interfere with the computers and sensors aboard satellites that pass through that region. “Currently, the SAA creates no visible impacts on daily life on the surface,” NASA points out. “However, recent observations and forecasts show that the region is expanding westward and continuing to weaken in intensity. It is also splitting – recent data shows the anomaly’s valley, or region of minimum field strength, has split into two lobes, creating additional challenges for satellite missions. ” Typically, satellite operators will turn off non-essential components as the orbiting hardware pass through the SAA region. That way, temporary or even permanent damage can be avoided. In order to do that, though, the position and spread of the SAA needs to be constantly mapped. During that mapping, NASA heliophysicist Ashley Greeley identified that the SAA is actually on the move. The region is shifting northwesterly, as the geomagnetic fields that help create it also shift. Now, like weather forecasters track patterns in the planet’s forces, NASA’s Planetary Geodynamics Laboratory at Goddard Space Flight Center are looking at longer-term forecasts of how the SAA might change in the coming years. As well as enabling better, more stable satellite design – and, beyond that, designs for future spacecraft intended to go to the Moon, Mars, and beyond – the tracking also has implications for our knowledge of Earth itself. The planet’s magnetic fields have a significant impact on many areas of life, not least Earth’s ability to withstand powerful storms of energized particles from the Sun that would otherwise be disruptive to systems on the ground.

So, potentially, this puppy has eaten one of the last remaining woolly rhinos,” he said. Scientists don’t know how the puppy came to have a piece of rhino in its stomach. Edana Lord, a PhD student at the Centre for Palaeogenetics who co-authored a paper studying the demise of the woolly rhino, said that the creatures would have been roughly the same size as the modern-day white rhino — making it unlikely that the puppy killed the beast itself. The researchers also found it curious that the puppy died shortly after eating the rhino. “This puppy must have died very shortly after eating the rhino, because it’s not very digested,” Dalen said. “We don’t know if it was a wolf, but if it was a wolf cub, maybe it came across a baby rhino that was dead, or the (adult) wolf ate the baby rhino,” he speculated. “Maybe as they were eating it, the mother rhino had her revenge. ” The-CNN-Wire™ &amp; © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc. , a WarnerMedia Company.

    "body": "2020/08/18 - New Delhi: There is mixed news for white-collar professionals looking for a job. As people returned to offices and factories started humming, India Inc. has begun rolling out offers, but there is still some distance to go before the jobs market bounces back to pre-covid levels, data crunched by professional networking company LinkedIn underlined. Fact is, today there is more supply of labour than openings. LinkedIn stated that competition for jobs has doubled compared to six months ago, with the average number of applications per job posted on LinkedIn increasing from around 90 in January to 180 in June. This data captures the desperation in the employment market, battered ever since the lockdown was announced in March-end. Many companies retrenched employees and cut salaries to maintain cost structures. Industries hard hit have also sent employees on leave without pay. “As risks of second-wave of infections emerge, some states have begun lockdown again. Given all this uncertainty, we expect recovery to remain fairly flat in the coming weeks,” Pei Ying Chua, APAC lead economist at LinkedIn’s Economic Graph Team, said. Insights from the graph provide real-time information on trends in the labour market. LinkedIn currently has over 69 million users in India and over 50 million companies using its site globally, making it a reasonable barometer for white collar hiring activity. Now for the good news: between early-April and end-June, hiring on LinkedIn increased by 35 percentage points. The rise is encouraging considering the ferocity of the fall — the hiring rate, a measure of hires divided by LinkedIn membership — slumped to a low of below -50% year-on-year in April. While things have recovered since, the hiring rate is still around -15% year-on-year as of June-end. Meanwhile, CMIE’s unemployment data, which cuts across different collars, also reflected an upward trend. India’s unemployment rate, at nearly 24% in April, has moderated to below 8% in July. LinkedIn analysed how job seekers were looking to switch industries. Little surprise, those working in the more impacted industries wanted to pivot to greener pastures. “Compared to pre-covid, we see that job seekers currently in the badly-affected sectors such as recreation and travel, are 6. 8 times more likely to look for jobs in a different sector,” LinkedIn stated. Those in retail were 2. 4 times more likely to adjust their job search while professionals in entertainment and consumer goods were 1. 3 times more likely to apply to a different industry. LinkedIn’s data reflected that the top five jobs in-demand today were that of software engineers, business development managers, sales managers, business analysts, and content writers. "

    "body": "2020/08/18 - Mahindra has revealed the new gen Thar as a 2 door SUV – Here is a digital render of 4 door Thar The recent unveil of the 2020 Mahindra Thar has easily been one of the most anticipated auto-event since the 2020 Auto Expo. While the SUV has garnered praise for a lot of things, many enthusiasts have agreed that its grille design could have been better. In other words, this opens considerable business opportunities for car customization workshop owners. While it will be interesting to see all the various custom mod jobs once the car goes on sale post its launch, in the meanwhile, online graphics experts have already started modifying the 2020 Thar as per their taste and preference. One of the first modification render has been created by SRK Designs who have reimagined the 2020 Thar as a 4-door SUV with some inspiration from the Mahindra Armada. The designer has used the standard 2020 Thar as the base and added 2 additional doors on the side, making it a complete 4/5 door SUV – depending upon how you would like to categorize it as. Like many, it seems that the designer too isn’t a big fan of 2020 Thar’s face and hence decided to alter it as per his liking. Powering the new gen Thar 4 door / Armada 4×4 SUV will most likely be the same engine options which power the Thar. These include a 2. 2 litre 4 cylinder mHawk turbo diesel motor which can dish out 130 hp &amp; 320 Nm and a new 2 litre mStallion petrol motor which can churn out 150 hp &amp; 320 Nm of peak torque. Both the engines will come with MT &amp; AT options. On board the Thar 4 door, Mahindra could offer more powerful versions of the same engine. Thanks to being longer, the 4 door Thar will be able to accommodate 7 on the inside, if all seats are front facing. It can offer seating to even more, of the last row is replaced by side facing seats. Interiors will be plush and loaded with features, just like the Thar. It will have large touchscreen system, roof mounted speakers, washable seats, etc. Launch Plans As of now, Mahindra has not revealed any plans of launching a longer 4 door Thar. Depending on the success of the 2 door Thar, which will launch on 2nd Oct, Mahindra could decided to whether launch a longer version of Thar or not. For now, Mahindra is fully committed to launching the new gen Thar in India. The SUV was earlier expected to be launched at the 2020 Auto Expo, however Mahindra decided against that. Later, the Corona Virus pandemic &amp; lockdowns gripped the nation and the launch was delayed by around 3 months. Pricing of new Thar too will be unveiled on the same date as the launch date. Deliveries are expected to start on the same date. Expect the top-end Thar to easily breach the INR 15 lakh mark. What will be interesting to see is if Mahindra will price the Thar aggressively and end the top-end range around INR 16-17 lakhs or position the Thar as a premium lifestyle vehicle and price the top of the line trim around the INR 20 lakhs mark.

    "body": "2020/08/18 - The government’s efforts to woo firms moving out of China appear to be working as 24 companies plan to set up mobile phone factories in India. Assembly partners of giant players in the electronics segment such as Samsung and Apple have shown interest in moving to India. These companies have pledged investments to the tune of $1. 5 billion so as to establish mobile-phone factories, Bloomberg reported. The companies are planning to diversify supply chains amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and US-China trade war. So far, India has lagged behind countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Thailand in enticing these companies to set up plants in the country. However, the Indian government expects that the PLI could lead to production of $153 billion of manufactured goods and generation of nearly 1 million direct and indirect jobs. In March this year, the government had announced a production linked incentive scheme (PLI) for large scale electronics manufacturing to boost domestic manufacturing and attract large investments in mobile phone manufacturing and specified electronic components. The scheme extended an incentive of 4 per cent to 6 per cent on incremental sales (over base year) of goods manufactured in India and covered under target segments, to eligible companies, for a period of five years subsequent to the base year as defined. Later such incentives were also extended to other sectors including pharma, auto, textiles, and food processing under the program. According to recent reports, Apple has plans to expand manufacturing in India. Its supplier Foxconn is also planning to invest up to $1 billion in India. Foxconn’s planned investment in the plant near Chennai would take place over the course of three years. “There’s a strong request from Apple to its clients to move part of the iPhone production out of China,” Reuters had reported citing unidentified sources.

    "body": "2020/08/18 - Whenever a new virus enters the human population, one of immunologists’ first questions is how the body’s immune system reacts to it once the immune system clears it from the body. For certain viruses, getting them once (or being vaccinated once) means that you now have life-long immunity; in other cases, the immune system appears to forget how to defend against them after a short period of time. Now, for the good news: While previously some experts feared that a coronavirus vaccine might only confer short-term immunity, that may not be true. Recently, there has been a flurry of promising research signaling that those who recover from a coronavirus infection will have lasting immunity. Understanding the human body’s immune response is key to returning to any sense of normalcy in our world, and has repercussions for public health behaviors and vaccine development. According to one of the new studies, which has yet to be peer-reviewed and was posted on MedRxiv over the weekend, researchers at the University of Arizona conclude that “immunity is durable for at least several months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. ” Specifically, the research says a previously-infected person is immune to the coronavirus for at least three months, even after a mild infection; though researchers say that’s a conservative prediction, based on lack of long-term human health data for the nascent virus. The conclusion conflicts with earlier reports that suggested immunity was transient, meaning that it only lasted for a short period of time. Deepta Bhattacharya, associate professor of immunobiology at the University of Arizona and co-author of the paper, told Salon in an interview that he and his colleagues came to their conclusion after they measured antibodies and examined how long they were being produced in COVID-19 patients. “In most viral infections that are clear, we call these acute viral infections, early antibodies that are made and then they settle down, and usually what happens is that they hit a flat and stable point after that initial infection phase,” Bhattacharya said. “We were trying to see if that’s happening in COVID-19 survivors or not. ” It turns out, there is a similar antibody build-up to other acute viral infections. The study looked at 5,882 volunteers, including asymptomatic individuals. Bhattacharya told Salon that the researchers noted in the study that the antibodies are present up to at least three months because that’s the longest time frame they have measured, but it could be longer. “It’s not that the immunities are going to vanish all of a sudden after three months, we can say that it’s at least three months,” he said. “Now if I had to make a prediction based upon the first SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus, I think it would likely last for years. ” Bhattacharya said that this research is encouraging in terms of vaccine development. “I think from a vaccine standpoint, it basically sets the parameters of what we know is possible,” Bhattacharya added. “That doesn’t necessarily mean that a vaccine will work perfectly and it doesn’t necessarily mean that every single vaccine that’s out there is going to be very effective, but at least it tells us that this is a very much achievable goal, that this virus can be cleared and that you can generate immunity against it,” he said. According to another study, currently under review at the journal Nature, researchers concluded that mild COVID-19 infections display traditional “hallmarks associated with antiviral protective immunity. ” “We found that recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody and neutralizing plasma, as well as virus-specific memory B and T cells that not only persisted, but in some cases increased numerically over three months following symptom onset,” the researchers wrote. However, researchers won’t know for certain if reinfection is possible for a longer period of time until there is more evidence of people being exposed to the virus a second time, to observe if they are able to keep it at bay. After being infected with a virus, the human body creates proteins called antibodies that can detect and attack that virus if it reappears in the body. This is how the body develops immunity to an infection. How long that immunity lasts ranges on the type of infection: for example, once a person is infected with measles they are immune throughout their entire lives. But when it comes to seasonal coronaviruses, it’s a bit more complicated. For SARS and MERS, this line of defense is present in survivors, according to separate studies, around two years. Antibodies, which were studied in both papers, don’t last forever since they aren’t living cells. They’re unable to replenish themselves and they eventually disappear from the blood. Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases and associate professor in the Department of Pediatrics at the University of California, Davis, told Salon a long-term follow-up is needed to really understand immunity and how long it lasts due to antibodies. “You can measure the immune response but you don’t know for certain that that protects against infection until you do the studies,” Blumberg said. “We don’t know how long people who have been infected, how long they will be protected against future infection whether it’s a matter of months, similar to the other coronaviruses or maybe it’s longer. ” Because the immune system appears to react differently to this coronavirus compared to others, and because the most severe cases occur when the immune system overreacts, Blumberg said it’s possible that there could be a stronger immune response in those who have recovered. “If you look at what happens with other coronaviruses, less pathogenic ones, it looks like immunity after infections lasts for a few months and then you can get reinfected again, so that’s depressing,” Blumberg said. “But this isn’t exactly the same — we know it’s different. ” "

    "title": "Are you safe from COVID 19 if you ve had the common cold ",
    "body": "2020/08/18 - An article in Science recently generated a lot of interest by providing a possible explanation of why COVID-19 can be deadly to some yet go virtually unnoticed in others. Scientists at La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California showed that infection with common cold coronaviruses can generate an immune response that resembles key pieces of the immune response generated by SARS-CoV-2 – the virus that causes COVID-19. This raises the possibility that previous infection with one of the milder coronaviruses could make COVID-19 less severe. But how likely is this? And how does this relate to what we already know about coronaviruses? A few weeks ago, a different article sat at the center of the SARS-CoV-2 immunity debate. This one showed that the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 may decline over time. The findings raised concern that SARS-CoV-2 could infect a person many times and that a vaccine might not generate lasting protection. But the article focused on just one arm of the immune response, the B cells, which produce antibodies that help to clear an infection. T cells are also key to the immune response against viruses. They play a variety of roles, among them helping B cells to mature into disease-fighting machines. The article by Jose Mateus and colleagues at La Jolla Institute for Immunology is important because it shows that people keep T cells from the milder coronaviruses long enough to potentially interact with a new challenge by SARS-CoV-2 and that those T cells might even recognize SARS-CoV-2 and help to clear the infection. Antibodies latching onto a coronavirus to neutralize it. Kateryna Kon/Shutterstock The case for cross-immunity For epidemiologists, the evidence of waning immunity and cross-immunity didn’t come as a surprise. A study from 1990 showed that soldiers infected with one of the milder coronaviruses didn’t retain immunity for much longer than a year. Also, the boom-bust cycle that the milder coronaviruses undergo from year to year can be explained by a mix of waning immunity and cross-immunity. The milder coronaviruses can generate similar antibodies to the ones that are generated by the coronaviruses that cause Sars and Mers. These antibodies are so similar that they nearly tricked a British Columbia care facility into thinking they had an outbreak of Sars after the Sars epidemic had been declared over. In fact, the outbreak was caused by OC43, one of the coronaviruses that causes the common cold. Nevertheless, infections that generate structurally similar antibodies don’t necessarily provide cross-protection in a medically meaningful way. We’re still just not sure Evidence for cross-protection between all but the most closely related coronaviruses is scant. It is difficult to say whether the milder coronaviruses protect against SARS-CoV-2 partly because we have done so little surveillance on them. Ideally, we would be able to look at historical data to identify which communities experienced major outbreaks of each milder coronavirus strain over the past few years and then see if there is a link with less severe COVID-19 cases. Challenge studies, in which a person is intentionally infected with a milder coronavirus strain and then exposed to SARS-CoV-2, could also address the question but are dangerous and ethically fraught. For now, all we can say is that the possibility that the common coronaviruses might protect against SARS-CoV-2 remains just that – a possibility. Indeed, Mateus and colleagues describe this theory as “highly speculative. ” This article is republished from The Conversation by Stephen Kissler, Postdoctoral Researcher, Immunology and Infectious Diseases, University of Cambridge under a Creative Commons license.

According to the study, published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, the risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to close contacts of infected persons has not been well estimated. “We wanted to evaluate the risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to close contacts of persons infected with Covid-19 in Guangzhou region,” said study researchers from Southern Medical University in China. For the findings, the research team tracked more than 3,410 close contacts of 391 Covid-19 index cases between January and March 2020 to evaluate the risk for the disease transmission in different settings. They found that risk for secondary transmission of the novel coronavirus was less than four per cent among close contacts of persons with Covid-19. In addition, secondary infections acquired while using public transportation were rare. In contrast, one in 10 household contacts was found to be infected. The researchers also found that patients with more clinically severe disease were more likely to infect their close contacts than were less severe index cases. Those with asymptomatic cases were the least likely to infect their close contacts, the study said. According to the team, the manifestation of certain symptoms, such as expectoration, in index cases, was also associated with an increased risk for infection in their close contacts. “In conclusion, we found that the secondary attack rate of Covid-19 was relatively low, and household contacts were at higher risk of infection,” the study authors wrote. “Moreover, patients with more clinically severe cases or those with symptoms were more likely to infect their close contacts,” the team noted.

    "body": "2020/08/18 - SRINAGAR: Researchers have found the likely order in which Covid-19 symptoms first appear — fever, followed by cough, muscle pain, and then nausea, and/or vomiting and diarrhoea. Knowing the order of the Covid-19 symptoms may help patients seek care promptly or decide sooner than later to self-isolate. According to the study, published in the journal Frontiers in Public Health, recognising the order of symptoms also could help doctors plan how to treat patients, and perhaps intervene earlier in the disease. “This order is especially important to know when we have overlapping cycles of illnesses like the flu that coincide with infections of Covid-19,” said study author Peter Kuhn from the University of Southern California in the US. “Given that there are now better approaches to treatments for Covid-19, identifying patients earlier could reduce hospitalisation time,” said another study author Joseph Larsen. Fever and cough are frequently associated with a variety of respiratory illnesses, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). But the timing and symptoms in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract set Covid-19 apart. “The upper GI tract (i. e. , nausea/vomiting) seems to be affected before the lower GI tract (i. e. , diarrhoea) in Covid-19, which is the opposite from MERS and SARS,” the scientists wrote. The authors predicted the order of symptoms this spring from the rates of symptom incidence of more than 55,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in China, all of which were collected by the World Health Organization. They also studied a dataset of nearly 1,100 cases collected from December 11, 2019, through January 29, 2020, by the China Medical Treatment Expert Group via the National Health Commission of China. To compare the order of Covid-19 symptoms to influenza, the researchers examined data from 2,470 cases in North America, Europe and the Southern Hemisphere, which were reported to health authorities from 1994 to 1998. According to the researchers, the order of the symptoms matter. “Knowing that each illness progresses differently means that doctors can identify sooner whether someone likely has Covid-19, or another illness, which can help them make better treatment decisions,” Larsen noted.

    "body": "2020/07/30 - Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg stumbled at a congressional hearing on alleged abuse of market power on Wednesday, as lawmakers confronted the social media titan with damaging internal emails about the company’s acquisitions. The House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel appeared to draw on a rich trove of Facebook company emails, releasing numerous screenshots of correspondence from Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives. Using the exchanges, lawmakers got Zuckerberg to acknowledge that he saw photo-sharing app Instagram and messaging app WhatsApp as competitors when Facebook acquired them. “The businesses are nascent but…if they grow to a large scale they could be very disruptive to us,” Zuckerberg wrote in 2012, two months before the Instagram purchase. In another email, written the same day Facebook announced the acquisition, Zuckerberg conceded that “Instagram was our threat,” adding: “one thing about startups though is you can often acquire them. ” Representative Joe Neguse, a Democrat, noted that a 2014 email showed Facebook’s CFO referring to the company’s acquisition strategy as a “land grab. ” “We have name for this; it is monopoly,” Neguse said. The committee presented fewer such exchanges to the other executives testifying at the hearing, which also featured Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Alphabet-owned Google’s Sundar Pichai and Apple’s Tim Cook. Democratic Representative Pramila Jayapal used an email to grill Zuckerberg on whether Facebook copied competitors like Snapchat for anti-competitive reasons. “How many competitors did Facebook end up copying?” she asked. “I don’t know,” Zuckerberg answered, stammering. She asked if Facebook had ever threatened to clone a competitor’s feature while negotiating to buy them. “I would like to just remind you that you are under oath and there are quotes from Facebook’s own documents,” she told him.

    "body": "2020/07/30 - Around 88 per cent of workforce in India prefers to have the flexibility to work from home (WFH), and 69 per cent of Indian employees believe their efficiency has increased while working remotely – highest in the Asia Pacific region, according to a report by SAP Concur. According to the report, many Indian firms still run manual finance and administrative processes, resulting in inefficiencies that lead to productivity losses, which is estimated to be to the tune of over Rs 16,800 crore. For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here “Remote work will be the default mode of work for many organisations in the foreseeable future. Embracing this change, 88 per cent of employees in India have expressed their preference to have the flexibility of remote working,” the SAP Concur report said. The reported is based on a survey, conducted in May, of 300 senior management to executive level employees. It found that 69 per cent of Indian employees believe their productivity has increased while working from home, which is higher than their other APAC counterparts with an overall average of 60 per cent. “These figures show positive signs of large scale acceptance of the upcoming ‘new normal’ in the country at a time when Covid-19 pandemic has forced the companies to implement remote working almost overnight,” the report said. Indian employees spent an average of 6. 1 hours per month filing expense claims, more than half of a typical workday. “Managers had it worse – they spent an additional 7. 3 hours reviewing and approving expense claims with the total time adding up to an astonishing 13. 4 hours a month,” it said. According to the report, merely 11 per cent of Indian organisations have embraced end-to-end digital finance and administrative processes which take up significant employee time that can otherwise be used for productive work. Across India, 36 per cent of mid-large sized companies are still using manual processes for submitting business expenses. Asia Insight, the entity which conducted the survey, used International Labour Organization (ILO) statistics on output per worker and the number of workers, and the survey’s results to calculate the impact of manual process in terms of potential revenue loss. It derived that saving just 10 per cent of the time spent on filing and approving claims would translate to US 2. 25 billion (Rs 16,827 crore) of potential GDP revenue gain for India each year, assuming all the lost hours are diverted to productive work. CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH “2020 is proving to be a turning point for companies in terms of managing employee experience and productivity. “While employees working remotely are being supported digitally in many areas, there still exists a major gap in digital adoption for crucial yet often overlooked finance and administrative processes,” Mankiran Chowhan, Managing Director – Indian Subcontinent, SAP Concur said. He said bringing in digital transformation for expense claims or invoice processing can have a huge multiplier effect on business and cost control, and at the same time provide the operational agility needed for business continuity. Beyond the inefficiency costs, the study also found that current expense management systems’ support for modern payment methods is inadequate. “More than a third (39 per cent) of respondents said they want their expense management software to integrate with external apps to enable added functionality like reimbursement of payments made through apps,” it said.

    "body": "2020/07/30 - A study recently identified 21 existing drugs that could improve the effect of remdesivir Remdesivir, produced by Gilead Sciences, has been marked as the drug that can fight COVID-19. Think of remdesivir then as a superhero – how much of an impact would it make without the support of others? Other drugs could significantly impact how well remdesivir acts in the human body, and make the crucial difference for patients. A Nature study authored by a global team of scientists and led by Sumit Chanda, PhD, professor at Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, has identified 21 existing drugs that stop the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The scientists analysed one of the world’s largest collections of known drugs for their ability to block the replication of SARS-CoV-2, and reported 100 molecules with confirmed antiviral activity in laboratory tests. Of these, 21 drugs were determined to be effective at concentrations that could be safely achieved in patients. Notably, four of these compounds were found to work synergistically with remdesivir, a current standard-of-care treatment for COVID-19. Chanda, director of the Immunity and Pathogenesis Program at Sanford Burnham Prebys and senior author of the study, commented: “Remdesivir has proven successful at shortening the recovery time for patients in the hospital, but the drug doesn’t work for everyone who receives it. That’s not good enough. “As infection rates continue to rise in America and around the world, the urgency remains to find affordable, effective, and readily available drugs that can complement the use of remdesivir, as well as drugs that could be given prophylactically or at the first sign of infection on an outpatient basis. ” The story behind the 21 drugs In the study, the research team performed extensive testing and validation studies, including evaluating the drugs on human lung biopsies that were infected with the virus, evaluating the drugs for synergies with remdesivir, and establishing dose-response relationships between the drugs and antiviral activity. Of the 21 drugs that were effective at blocking viral replication, the scientists found: 13 have previously entered clinical trials for other indications and are effective at concentrations, or doses, that could potentially be safely achieved in COVID-19 patients. Two are already FDA approved: astemizole (allergies), clofazamine (leprosy), and remdesivir has received Emergency Use Authorization from the agency (COVID-19). Four worked synergistically with remdesivir, including the chloroquine derivative hanfangchin A (tetrandrine), an antimalarial drug that has reached Phase 3 clinical trials. Chanda further said: “This study significantly expands the possible therapeutic options for COVID-19 patients, especially since many of the molecules already have clinical safety data in humans. This report provides the scientific community with a larger arsenal of potential weapons that may help bring the ongoing global pandemic to heel. ” “Based on our current analysis, clofazimine, hanfangchin A, apilimod and ONO 5334 represent the best near-term options for an effective COVID-19 treatment. “While some of these drugs are currently in clinical trials for COVID-19, we believe it’s important to pursue additional drug candidates so we have multiple therapeutic options if SARS-CoV-2 becomes drug resistant. ” The researchers are currently testing all 21 compounds in small animal models and “mini lungs,” or lung organoids, that mimic human tissue. If these studies are favourable, the team will approach the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to discuss a clinical trial evaluating the drugs as treatments for COVID-19. Examining over 12,000 drugs to find 21 The drugs were first identified by high-throughput screening of more than 12,000 drugs from the ReFRAME drug repurposing collection–the most comprehensive drug repurposing collection of compounds that have been approved by the FDA for other diseases or that have been tested extensively for human safety. Arnab Chatterjee, PhD, vice president of medicinal chemistry at Calibr and co-author on the paper, says ReFRAME was established to tackle areas of urgent unmet medical need, especially neglected tropical diseases. Dr Chatterjee commented: “We realized early in the COVID-19 pandemic that ReFRAME would be an invaluable resource for screening for drugs to repurpose against the novel coronavirus,” says Chatterjee. The drug screen was completed as rapidly as possible due to Chanda’s partnership with the scientist who discovered the first SARS virus, Kwok-Yung Yuen, M. D. , chair of Infectious Diseases at the University of Hong Kong; and Shuofeng Yuan, Ph. D. , assistant research professor in the Department of Microbiology at the University of Hong Kong, who had access to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in February 2020. "

To be sure, the study was based on a small sample and needs further (and more extensive) research and validation, but it adds to the number of body organs affected by the virus. The study also found that 60% of those infected with Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, had an ongoing myocardial inflammation (swelling of heart muscles); it has been published in the journal ‘JAMA Cardiology’ on Monday. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage The study, Outcomes of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Patients Recently Recovered From Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), looked at the cardiovascular effects in patients who suffered from Covid-19. Data from about 100 recovered patients from the University Hospital, Frankfurt’s Covid-19 registry between April and June 2020 was analysed for the study. “…cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed cardiac involvement in 78 patients (78%) and ongoing myocardial inflammation in 60 patients (60%), which was independent of preexisting conditions, severity and overall course of the acute illness, and the time from the original diagnosis,” the study added. . The researchers emphasise upon the need for studying in detail long-term cardiovascular consequences of Covid-19. Experts in India have also been asking for examination of clinical data to know the long-term health impact among Covid-19 patients post recovery as there have been observations made by clinicians on recently recovered patients experiencing long-term effects. “It is a huge percentage, and looks like induced by virus or its after-effects such as inflammation. There is a need for large studies to reach a conclusion but that would require funding and access to data,” says Dr Giridhara Babu, head, Life Course epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health, Public Health Foundation of India. Clinicians here have observed that Covid-19 leads to other long-term health complications involving kidneys, liver, even eyes in patients after discharge from hospital. The joint monitoring group under the Union health ministry’s technical wing- Directorate General of Health Services, is independently reviewing clinical data available so far to draft guidelines for managing post-recovery health complications. “Our experts are working on putting a document together to guide people on what kind of long-term care would be required,” said Rajesh Bhushan, officer on special duty, health ministry. The group is chaired by Dr Rajiv Garg, director general health services, along with specialist doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, and representatives of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and World Health Organisation (WHO) office in India . The data is being collected from several hospitals across the country that are treating Covid-19 patients. The hospitals include three from Delhi: The central government-run Safdarjung Hospital, Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, and Lady Hardinge Hospital. Apart from these, clinical data is also being sought from six other All India Institute of Medical Sciences that treat Covid-19 patients. "

    "body": "2020/07/29 - Widely shared social media post claim the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that positive COVID-19 results simply mean people have previously contracted a cold. In reality, the claim is a misinterpretation of a paragraph discussing antibody tests on the CDC’s website. Health experts confirm COVID-19 is detected with viral tests, not an analysis of antibodies. “SHOCKER: CDC admits COVID-19 ‘positive result’ just means you’ve previously contracted the common cold,” one Facebook post says. A screenshot of a false Facebook post, taken on July 23, 2020 Similar Facebook posts from the US have been archived here and here. Also Read: WHO Has Not Said Cats And Dogs Cannot Contract COVID-19 This Polish Facebook post shared a screenshot of the actual paragraph from the CDC’s website. The caption translates to: “American CDC reports that a positive test result (allegedly for COVID-19) could mean that you had any other cold or flu caused by other coronaviruses”. Screenshot of the misleading Polish Facebook post, taken on July 27, 2020 The screenshot used in the post can be found on the CDC website under the topic: “Test for Past Infection (Antibody Test)”. A screenshot of the paragraph (in the red rectangle) on CDC website, taken on July 24, 2020 But health experts say the social media posts have misinterpreted the paragraph – including Kenyan doctor Githinji Gitahi, a board member of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. The institution is part of the African Union and unrelated to the American CDC. Viral test to confirm COVID-19 Gitahi, who also runs the medical NGO Amref Health Africa, told AFP Fact Check there are two types of tests for COVID-19 – the direct or viral test, and the indirect test, also referred to as the antibody test. Blood samples are used to check for traces of antibodies, which indicate if someone was previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 – the virus that causes COVID-19. Also Read: No, WHO Is Not Advertising Home-based Jobs To Fight COVID-19 The viral test, meanwhile, uses samples from the respiratory system, such as a swab from the inside of your nose, throat or lungs to detect an ongoing COVID-19 infection. “Since there is currently no antibody test that is specific to antibodies produced to fight SARS-CoV-2, there is a likelihood to test positive if one tests for antibodies but it might not be because of COVID-19 but because the antibodies came from other coronaviruses, even the one that causes the common cold,” Gitahi said. “Because of this confusion, we do not use the antibody test to confirm COVID-19 infection but we use the viral test, which is conducted in the nose or throat with swabs or in the lungs. ” Antibody tests used for surveillance The US-based CDC told AFP Fact Check that a viral test will not produce a positive result for COVID-19 from the traces of other human coronaviruses. “The viral test detects the SARS-CoV-2 virus in respiratory samples. The presence of other human coronaviruses in a respiratory sample do not produce a positive result on a diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2,” spokeswoman Jasmine Reed said in an email. “A positive result on an antibody test might mean that a person had a past infection with SARS-CoV-2. But there is a small chance that antibodies from an infection with a different coronavirus, such as the one that causes the common cold, might cause a positive result on a SARS-CoV-2 antibody test. ” WHO acknowledges that antibody tests such as serology testing can be used in COVID-19 surveillance to measure the extent of infection in the population. But it cautions against the uncertainty of the test in terms of sensitivity and specificity, and its ability to “assess cross-reactivity” with other coronaviruses. "

    "title": "72 of US adults are wearing masks what is the data for India ",
    "body": "2020/07/29 - Over the past month the Covid map of India has transformed. Not only did 65% of the cases on Sunday come from outside Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi, half of India’s districts now have over 500 cases each. On the good news front treatment protocols are greatly improved and testing capacity is being ramped up sharply in several places, efforts are underway for the country to do a million tests a day in a few weeks, and various vaccine trials are progressing well in the world. But Google extending its global work from home option for employees till June 30 next year is just one of many indicators that the virus shall not be overcome anytime soon. Doing everything possible to arrest its spread is therefore imperative, to limit the wreckage of lives and livelihoods before a vaccine becomes available. Masks are a central part of this defense, their return on investment is quite incomparable. But reflective of the general scarcity of good data in India, we have no nationwide estimate of how prevalent mask wearing has become. A Stanford University study suggests a great disparity in the quality of Covid-19 data reporting across India. Overall there is significant shortage of granular details like age, gender, comorbidities and even districts. But it is this granularity that can make some of the most productive interventions possible. On mask wearing, likewise, if we had the data we could put more public and even private resources into the regions or demographics that have not taken to the habit out of either cultural or financial reasons. In the US, where of course there is a weird political constituency for the cause of not wearing masks, a Fortune magazine and SurveyMonkey poll suggests that 67% of all Americans now wear masks. More heavy-duty polling by Ipsos, Pew and Gallop also enables tracking behavioral improvement over the months. An online Gallup Panel survey conducted between June 29-July 5 found 54% of American women as compared to 34% American men saying that they always wear a mask outside their home, which maybe suggests the need to rope in some serious male/macho role models in public service campaigns about how masks save lives (and jobs). That overall 44% of US adults said they “always” wear a mask when outside their homes and 28% said they do so “very often” indicates how far this simple and yet powerful tool is still from the near universal adoption as seen in countries like Japan. What about India? What percentage of the population is masking up? Which segments are showing resistance? How much of this is for financial reasons? We don’t know. But we should find out. There is the dangling on the neck error. Another widely reported error is pulling down the mask just when one starts talking – Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot did this just last week while addressing a large group of mediapersons crowded next to him, Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan did the same at no less than a Covid ward where he is admitted and from where he was broadcasting to the public with various health service providers also present in the ward. There are also people who are wearing the same mask days on end without washing it regularly. Without essential mask hygiene, like not touching its outer surface because that is at risk of virus deposits, the mask can become useless. Surely there is still not enough conversation about this. And this conversation needs to take place especially with all those who do not have the luxury of work from home, who are out and about in the great Unlock that hopes to put the country on the economic recovery path. Plus, mask prices have dropped considerably. Surgical ones are to be had for Rs 5 now, and bulk prices would be much lower. Governments can make bulk purchases and organize mask distribution camps, where say a week’s supply is handed out alongside basic instructions. This would help put information about proper use into the wider ecosystem, where of course homemade masks also play a key role. Let’s get our act together on this. "

    "body": "2020/07/29 - In an industry where getting one drug developed from lab to clinic can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and decades of time, it helps when scientists can be thrifty and make use of substances that already exist. A global team of researchers has now done just that, by searching through one of the world’s largest collections of already developed drugs to discover 21 potential treatments for COVID-19. We will need considerably more research to determine if any of these drugs can be used to help COVID-19 patients, but it’s an excellent first step, bypassing some of the barriers for producing completely new drugs. “The development of a vaccine is likely to require at least 12-18 months, and the typical timeline for approval of a novel antiviral therapeutic can exceed 10 years,” the team writes in their new paper. “Thus, repurposing of known drugs could significantly accelerate the deployment of novel therapies for COVID-19. ” The researchers took the ReFRAME Drug Repurposing Library - 11,987 compounds which have either received FDA approval or made it to clinical-trials – and began testing them against SARS-CoV-2 in a line of cells called Vero, cultured from the kidney of an African green monkey (Chlorocebus sp. ). “We realised early in the COVID-19 pandemic that ReFRAME would be an invaluable resource for screening for drugs to repurpose against the novel coronavirus,” says medical chemist and study co-author Arnab Chatterjee from Calibr, the drug discovery division of Scripps Research that created ReFRAME. As was expected, the vast majority of the tests didn’t result in much, but the team did find 100 compounds that inhibited viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells. The team then demonstrated that 21 of those 100 compounds had a dose-response relationship – meaning the dose required to be effective wasn’t also likely to cause harm to humans. One of these was remdesivir, so that leaves 20 yet to be tested for COVID-19 treatment. Of those 21 drugs, 13 were found to be effective at concentrations that could be safely used in COVID-19 patients and had previously entered clinical trials. “This study significantly expands the possible therapeutic options for COVID-19 patients, especially since many of the molecules already have clinical safety data in humans,” said virologist Sumit Chanda from Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute in California. “This report provides the scientific community with a larger arsenal of potential weapons that may help bring the ongoing global pandemic to heel. ” The 21 drugs are currently being tested further using small animal models or mini lungs that can mimic human tissue. However, the team has already found three that worked in human stem cell-derived lung tissue, and one showed antiviral effects in a lab-based lung culture system. This is all exciting stuff, but as we’ve seen in many examples so far, caution is needed before rushing into the administration of new drugs, even during a pandemic - not all promising compounds will actually work against COVID-19, even if those drugs have been approved for other ailments in the past. The more treatments we have however, the better. “While some of these drugs are currently in clinical trials for COVID-19, we believe it’s important to pursue additional drug candidates so we have multiple therapeutic options,” says Chanda. The research has been published in Nature. "

While 26 per cent Indians facing mild depression, 17 per cent face a more strenuous kind. It is concerning to note that 6 per cent Indians are severely depressed. GOQii, the smart-tech-enabled preventive healthcare platform, conducted a survey across 10,000+ Indians to understand how Covid-19 has changed lifestyle and how Indians are adapting to the new normal. This is a comparative study and highlights the glaring difference in lifestyle habits pre-Coronavirus and post lockdown. Vishal Gondal, founder and CEO, GOQii said, “Our study indicates that an increasing number of people across the country are dealing with mental health issues triggered by the spread of the Coronavirus and the consequent lockdown. The mounting uncertainty is the basis of the high stress index which can be controlled with a balanced diet, changes in lifestyle and appropriate sleep patterns. We at GOQii believe that preventive healthcare is the future and the only viable, long-term solution given the huge load on the healthcare system in India. Mental health has a huge impact on physical health and overall quality of life, hence, addressing it sooner with a healthy and wholesome lifestyle is the only way ahead. ” 59 per cent people show less interest in things According to the self-administered, patient health questionnaire PHQ – 9, consisting of nine areas, monitors the severity of depression and response in a population "

    "body": "2020/07/29 - Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve learned that the coronavirus attacks much more than just your respiratory system. There are symptoms of the virus that affect everything from your mouth to your digestive tract. Now, a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Cardiology has found that one of the more frightening lingering effects of COVID-19 is also very common. According to the JAMA Cardiology study, nearly 80 percent of COVID patients have heart damage. The research, which was conducted out of Germany’s University Hospital Frankfurt, examined the MRI scans of 100 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, most of whom were otherwise healthy and in their 40s and 50s. The scans showed that 78 of the patients (78 percent) had signs of heart damage. Furthermore, 60 percent of the patients showed signs of inflammation. The researchers say these startling findings demonstrate the need for “ongoing investigation of the long-term cardiovascular consequences of COVID-19. ” The study’s lead author, Valentina Putmann, MD, cardiologist and clinical pharmacologist at University Hospital Frankfurt, told Stat, “The fact that 78 percent of ‘recovered’ [patients] had evidence of ongoing heart involvement means that the heart is involved in a majority of patients, even if COVID-19 illness does not scream out with the classical heart symptoms, such as anginal chest pain. ” In a recent paper, JAMA Cardiology editors Clyde W. Yancy, MD, and Gregg C. Fonarow, MD, cite this new study as evidence that they “see the plot thickening. ” They write: “We are inclined to raise a new and very evident concern that cardiomyopathy and heart failure related to COVID-19 may potentially evolve as the natural history of this infection becomes clearer. ” Unfortunately, while the new German study did begin to answer some questions, it also opened the door for even more queries. “The question now is how long these changes persist?” cardiologist Matthew Tomey, MD, who was not involved with the study, told Stat. “Are these going to become chronic effects upon the heart, or are these—we hope—temporary effects on cardiac function that will gradually improve over time?” RELATED: For more up-to-date information, sign up for our daily newsletter.

    "body": "2020/07/29 - Google has removed 29 apps from the Play Store which were found filled with adware. These Android apps had over 3. 5 million downloads on the Play Store. White Ops’ Satori threat intelligence team discovered these 29 apps as part of their “CHARTREUSEBLUR” investigation. The word blur in the codename of the investigation is due to the fact that most of the malicious apps were photo editing apps which had a blur feature. As for the word “chartreuse” the team just found it fun to say and that the liquor is tasty. These Android apps were found running out-of-context (OOC) ads which are said to be used to avoid detection. After the user installs any of these apps, the launch icons would immediately disappear from the phone. This made it difficult for users to remove the malicious app from their phones. One such app with adware was the Square Photo Blur app. The Satori team tested this app and discovered a “hollow shell of an app” which managed to pass the Play Store security checks. The app obviously didn’t function as advertised and instead ran OOC ads on phones. Once the app was installed on the phone the launch icon disappeared and there was no “open” function on the Play Store either. Ads that popped on up through these apps happened within intervals of only a few seconds. Also, almost every action the user performed on their phone triggered a code in the app for ads to pop-up. Some of these actions include unlocking the phone, uninstalling an app, charging the phone or even switching from mobile data to Wi-Fi. The ads pop up and occupy the whole screen of the phone. It’s not just ads though. The Square Photo Blur app even managed to launch an OOC web browser randomly. 29 Android apps have been identified with this malicious adware. But there could be more in the future. you can get full list here get the PDF directly. and uninstall them. The Satori team also advises to look out for hints like - reviews of the apps mentioning ads popping up all the time, apps disappearing after downloading it, a lot of 5-star reviews but recent ones are mostly 1-star, app doesn’t work as advertised, app received a lot of downloads in a very short time. Some of these points can act as indicators that the app is probably a malicious one. Google recently removed 11 apps from the Play Store which contained the Joker malware. These apps have been lurking around since 2017. Hackers have managed to introduce new variants of the Joker malware in Android apps. The malicious apps are no longer there but they may appear again in the future. "

    "body": "2020/07/24 - Eating chocolate at least once a week is linked with a reduced risk of heart disease, according to research published today in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, a journal of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). “Our study suggests that chocolate helps keep the heart’s blood vessels healthy,” said study author Dr. Chayakrit Krittanawong of Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas. “In the past, clinical studies have shown that chocolate is beneficial for both blood pressure and the lining of blood vessels,” he continued. “I wanted to see if it affects the blood vessels supplying the heart (the coronary arteries) or not. And if it does, is it beneficial or harmful?” The researchers conducted a combined analysis of studies from the past five decades examining the association between chocolate consumption and coronary artery disease (the blockage of the coronary arteries). The analysis included six studies with a total of 336,289 participants who reported their chocolate consumption. During a median follow-up of nearly nine years, 14,043 participants developed coronary artery disease and 4,667 had a heart attack (when coronary artery disease progresses and the flow of blood to the heart is suddenly blocked). Compared with consuming chocolate less than once a week, eating chocolate more than once a week was associated with an 8% decreased risk of coronary artery disease. Dr. Krittanawong said: “Chocolate contains heart-healthy nutrients such as flavonoids, methylxanthines, polyphenols and stearic acid which may reduce inflammation and increase good cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein or HDL cholesterol). ” He noted that the study did not examine whether any particular type of chocolate is more beneficial and whether there is an ideal portion size. “Chocolate appears promising for prevention of coronary artery disease, but more research is needed to pinpoint how much and what kind of chocolate could be recommended,” he said. While it’s not clear how much chocolate is optimal, Dr. Krittanawong warned against overeating. He said: “Moderate amounts of chocolate seem to protect the coronary arteries but it’s likely that large quantities do not. The calories, sugar, milk, and fat in commercially available products need to be considered, particularly in diabetics and obese people. ” Reference: “Association between chocolate consumption and risk of coronary artery disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis” 22 July 2020, European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.

In hot and dry climates, where these droplets cover a distance of only 6 to 8 feet, in cold and damp environments, these droplets can go up to 13 feet. Then even if there is no wind during this… -During the weather changes on droplets coming out of the mouth through breath while coughing and sneezing was done in America. The main objective of doing this research is to know the possibility of spreading any respiratory disease according to the weather. This research has recently been published in General ‘Physics of Fluids’. The special thing is that scientists of Indian origin are doing this research done in America. Why antibodies once made in the body will not protect against corona throughout life? This is the first model in itself that is based on the collagen rate theory of chemical reactions and has been done keeping in mind the speed of propagation of droplets. So that it can be accurately ascertained what is the time and speed of spread of these droplets from an infected person to a healthy person in a season. Cold and damp environment spreads more Corona infection The origin of this chemical process depends on the speed with which the two molecules collide with each other. The sooner these molecules collide with each other, the faster the reaction will be seen. Similarly, the more people who come in contact with droplets released from the body of an infected person, the faster the infection will spread. This is to say the study’s author and Abhishek Saha of the University of California. Handmade Face Mask For Covid-19: Method of making and storing hygienic masks of cotton at home – The researcher says that the distance the droplets will travel from the infected person depends to a large extent on the weather. Droplets released from the infected person’s body through cough and sneezing can go up to 8 to 13 feet. Wind speeds have not been added to this speed of droplets. That is, if these droplets meet with the wind, then their journey may be longer. At the same time until these droplets are evaporated by air. Again the importance of masks – This study once proved the usefulness of the mask. That is, if both the healthy person and the infected person have not worn the mask, then there will be no benefit of social distancing. Because even in social distancing, people are able to stand at a distance of more than 4 to 6 feet. In such a situation, we can all understand how important it is for all people to wear masks.

    "body": "2020/07/24 - Earlier studies have shown that cinnamon, a commonly used spice provides many health benefits, including the ability to lower blood sugar and help manage diabetes. Cinnamon contains bioactive components that can help lower blood sugar levels. The incidence of type II diabetes is increasing across the world. Dietary modifications help the patients to control blood sugar. Traditional herbs and spices are commonly used for control of blood sugar among which cinnamon (Ròu Guì; Cinnamomum cassia) has the greatest effect. With increasing number of patients of diabetes, Identifying strategies to prevent the progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes has become challenging, yet it is important to find measures to control blood sugar in patients with Prediabetes or overt diabetes. “Our 12-week study showed beneficial effects of adding cinnamon to the diet on keeping blood sugar levels stable in participants with prediabetes,” said the study’s corresponding author, Giulio R. Romeo, M. D. , of Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, Mass. “These findings provide the rationale for longer and larger studies to address if cinnamon can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes over time. ” The randomized clinical trial investigated the effects of cinnamon supplementation in 51 participants with prediabetes. Participants were given a 500 mg cinnamon capsule or placebo three times a day for 12 weeks. The researchers found that cinnamon supplements lowered abnormal fasting glucose levels and improved the body’s response to eating a meal with carbohydrates, which are hallmarks of prediabetes. Cinnamon was well tolerated and was not associated with specific side effects or adverse events.

    "body": "2020/07/24 - For sale masks are seen displayed on a clothesline in the front yard of a house in Los Angeles on July 20, 2020. A home-made cloth face mask likely needs two or three layers to be effective in preventing the spread of the coronavirus, according to an observational study published Thursday in the medical journal Thorax. Researchers at the University of New South Wales in Australia looked at the effectiveness of single and double-layer cloth face coverings at reducing the spread of respiratory droplets that pass when an infected person speaks, coughs or sneezes. They then compared those results with that of a three-ply surgical face mask. The researchers used LED lighting and a high-speed camera to film the dispersal of airborne droplets produced by a healthy person with no respiratory infection. The video for speaking was captured at 850 frames per second, while coughing and sneezing was framed 1,000 frames per second due to the higher expulsion speeds, they said. A three-ply surgical face mask was the most effective at reducing airborne droplet dispersal, the researchers found after reviewing the footage. The single-layer covering reduced the droplet spread from speaking, though the double layer covering was better in reducing droplets from coughing and sneezing, according to the researchers. “A cloth face covering with at least two layers is preferable to a single-layer one,” Prateek Bahl, School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, UNSW Sydney, Australia, and a lead author of the study, wrote in the findings. “Guidelines on home-made cloth masks should stipulate multiple layers. ” To be sure, the researchers said a single-layer face covering is better than no face covering at all. Additionally, several other factors determine the efficacy of cloth masks such as type of material, the number of layers, the arrangement of different layers and frequency of washing, they said. The single-layer face covering was made from a folded piece of cotton T-shirt and hair ties. The double-layer covering was made using the sewing method as shown by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The researchers used tissue paper to simulate the mucus membrane of the nasal cavity and induce a sneeze, according to the study. The study comes as the Trump administration pushes for the public to adopt face coverings in an attempt to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The United States has the worst outbreak in the world with 4 million cases and at least 143,820 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. President Donald Trump’s response to the pandemic has also come under increasing scrutiny. In recent weeks, Trump has downplayed the threat of the virus, tying the surge in new cases to an increase in testing. However, public health officials and infectious disease experts dispute those claims, saying the rate of cases that test positive in the U. S. , hospitalizations and deaths remain high in some states. Trump endorsed masks for the first time this week after resisting them for months. The CDC began recommending face masks for the general public in April. Earlier in the day, Adm. Brett Giroir, an assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services, told reporters that 90% of the public or more need to wear face coverings in order to curb the spread of the virus. “If we close the indoor bars, reduce the occupancy of restaurants, have face coverings and hygiene, this is essentially equivalent to shutting down the entire economy, which means shutting down elective surgeries and everything else that goes with that,” he said.

    "body": "2020/07/24 - Professor Sarah Gilbert, who is leading development of a coronavirus vaccine at Oxford University, in Oxford, April 24, 2020. (Mary Turner/The New York Times) Professor Sarah Gilbert, who is leading development of a coronavirus vaccine at Oxford University, in Oxford, April 24, 2020. (Mary Turner/The New York Times) Earlier this week, there was positive news on the Oxford vaccine candidate, one of a clutch of frontrunner candidates to protect the world from the SARS-CoV-2 virus that had, until Friday (July 24) morning, infected nearly 15. 5 million people and killed over 630,000 worldwide. Leading its development is a British scientist who plays the oboe, cycles to work, and is the mother of triplets. Dr Sarah Gilbert was famous in the scientific community as a brilliant vaccinologist; with the success in early trials, she — and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the vaccine candidate her team is working on — has been spotlighted as never before. Gilbert and co-authors published the results of the early trials in the medical journal, The Lancet, on July 20, titled “Safety and immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: a preliminary report of a phase 1/2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial”. They wrote: “ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 showed an acceptable safety profile, and homologous boosting increased antibody responses. ” Which means that the vaccine candidate had induced an immune response (which is what vaccines are supposed to do), and was safe for people.       Don’t miss from Explained   How ‘corona’ of the virus changes into a hairpin shape — and why   What is Dr Gilbert’s work in the field of vaccine development? Dr Gilbert is one of the leading vaccinologists in the world. She is professor of vaccinology at Oxford University’s Jenner Institute, a prestigious vaccine research centre, and one of the two founders of its spin-out company, Vaccitech, which develops immunotherapy products to treat and prevent infectious disease and cancer. For more than 15 years, Dr Gilbert has been making and testing vaccines that trigger T cells — a type of white blood cells — to respond to antigens from malaria, influenza, and tuberculosis, among others. Her work also includes developing vaccines for influenza and emerging diseases such as Lassa, Nipah, CCHF, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). MERS, which appeared in 2014, too, is caused by a coronavirus. “A vaccine against MERS has been tested in clinical trials in the UK, and is now in trials in Saudi Arabia, where the virus is endemic,” says Gilbert’s page on the Jenner Institute website. The vaccine for MERS involved using the adenovirus (which causes common colds) from a chimpanzee embedded with the genetic material of the MERS virus. For the Covid-19 vaccine, the Oxford scientists used the adenovirus of a chimpanzee embedded with the genetic material from the spike protein, which the coronavirus uses to pierce the cell. In tests till now, bodies of participants have responded as if they were infected with the coronavirus. 📣 Express Explained is now on Telegram.

(John Cairns, University of Oxford via AP) What is known about the acclaimed scientist’s life away from her work? Dr Gilbert has not given many interviews since the publication of the results of the early phase trials. Earlier profiles of the scientist in the UK media have said that as a child in Northamptonshire’s Kettering High School for Girls, she was quiet, polite, and studious, getting a lot of ‘A’s in studies. Gilbert belongs to a family of musicians, and her mother, Hazel, was part of the town’s operatic society. By the age of 17, however, Gilbert was sure that she wanted to be a medical researcher. After obtaining a degree in biology at the University of East Anglia and a PhD in biochemistry from the University of Hull, Dr Gilbert worked at a number of biotechnology companies, among them Delta, where she learnt about making medicines. Profiles on Prof Gilbert have noted that she became a vaccine specialist rather by accident. In 1994, when she entered Oxford University to join Professor Adrian Hill’s lab in a senior postdoc position, it was to work on human genetics. “That highlighted the role of a particular type of immune response in protection against malaria, and so the next thing to move on to was to make a vaccine that would work through that type of immune response — and that’s how I got into vaccines,” she told UK’s The Telegraph newspaper in an interview. By 2007, Dr Gilbert, who had become a reader at Oxford University three years previously, had won a project grant from the Wellcome Trust, and had begun work on an influenza vaccine. She has developed two vaccines for the disease so far, and has said that her ultimate aim is to be able to develop her team of scientists to be the leaders in vaccine research in the world. A doctor takes blood samples for use in a coronavirus vaccine trial in Oxford, England, Thursday June 25, 2020. (John Cairns, University of Oxford via AP) A doctor takes blood samples for use in a coronavirus vaccine trial in Oxford, England, Thursday June 25, 2020. (John Cairns, University of Oxford via AP) Many people are fascinated with Dr Gilbert’s success in balancing the extra demands that women with a career in science face. According to UNESCO, women make up less than 30 per cent of the world’s researchers. In science, technology, engineering and mathematics, women also “publish less, are paid less for their research and do not progress as far as men in their careers”. On the website of the Nuffeld Department of Medicine (of which Jenner Institute, where she works, is a part), Dr Gilbert has been quoted as saying: “Work life balance is very difficult, and impossible to manage unless you have good support. Because I had triplets in 1998, nursery fees would have cost more than my entire income as a post-doctoral scientist, so my partner has had to sacrifice his own career in order to look after our children. ” She described how 18 weeks of paid maternity leave with three premature babies to care for and work to be completed, was tough: “If there is a three-year grant and a woman wants a year-long maternity leave, it can disrupt the progress of the project. The situation becomes worse if more than one person is away simultaneously. ” Dr Gilbert’s advice to women: “One of the good things about being a scientist is that the hours are not fixed, so there is a fair amount of flexibility for working mothers. Having said that, there are also times when things (such as overseas conferences and important meetings) are fixed and you have to make sacrifices. It is exceptionally hard work. It’s important to plan ahead, and make sure you have people who are willing to cover for you at home while you work. That might be your partner or relatives, or you may be able to buy in help. ” Her own children “seem to have survived unscathed, but none of them wants to be scientists”, she said. The big question: Will there be a vaccine this year? Dr Gilbert is cautiously hopeful. In an interview to the BBC, she said, “Nobody can be absolutely sure that it is possible. That’s why we have to do trials. I think the prospects are very good but it is not completely certain. ” 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

    "title": "A Tale Of Three Potential Vaccines How They Stack Up In The Race For Coronavirus Prevention",
    "body": "2020/07/24 - Towards the end of May, Oxford had already made the announcement of phase 2/3 human trials. These phases will involve testing of a much larger group of people and, more importantly, across a wider age group, to include children and elderly people. Trials have already begun in Brazil and South Africa. Testing of 30,000 patients is expected in the US as well. With the vaccine raising hope, the UK, the US, and others including Serum Institute of India (world’s largest vaccine producer by volume) have already entered into commitments with Oxford University and AstraZeneca to have more than 2 billion vaccine doses supplied to them. BNT162 Pfizer announced its five-point plan to battle Covid-19 on 13 March. Chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) Dr Albert Bourla called for collaboration in the fight against the virus and announced that his company was up to the task – “Pfizer is working to advance our own potential antiviral therapies and is engaged with BioNTech on a potential mRNA coronavirus vaccine. ” Three days later, Pfizer and BioNTech made it official that the two companies would jointly develop BioNTech’s mRNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162. This collaboration was natural since both Pfizer and BioNTech had been involved in joint research and development work for a couple of years already to develop mRNA-based vaccines for prevention of influenza. The BNT162 Covid-19 vaccine programme had multiple mRNA candidates. Progress was noted with antiviral activity recorded against SARS-CoV-2 in preclinical screening. By 22 April, the phase 1/2 clinical trial for the vaccine – with its four mRNA candidates – received a nod from the German regulatory authority, the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut. The trial kicked off immediately after that in Germany and, after approvals, a week later in the US. Preliminary data for a sub-group of 45 people arrived on 1 July. In an encouraging development, one of the four vaccine candidates, BNT162b1, was able to stimulate antibody responses at or above the levels observed in Covid-19-recovered plasma patients. Based on this data, the potential vaccines BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 were put on fast track by the US Food and Drug Administration. Preliminary data from the phase 1/2 trial for 60 people in Germany backed up the US data, demonstrating the ability of BNT162b1 to elicit high SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titers. In addition, T cell responses were observed for the first time for any Pfizer-BioNTech candidate. On the back of the good results, both the UK and the US entered into agreements with Pfizer and BioNTech to procure an initial 30 million and 100 million doses of their vaccine respectively after the necessary approvals. As more data trickles in from the phase 1/2 trials, the collaborators get to pick their lead vaccine candidate and decide on the dose level to be administered to a much larger group – possibly involving up to 30,000 volunteers – in succeeding trials, slated to get underway in July. Efforts have been on to ramp up manufacturing capabilities to enhance the production capacity. The Pfizer-BioNTech combine is currently expecting to manufacture “up to 100 million doses by the end of 2020 and potentially more than 1. 3 billion doses by the end of 2021”. mRNA-1273 The American biotechnology company Moderna in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health finalised the sequence for their vaccine candidate mRNA-1273 two days after the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus was made known by China. In an astounding achievement, the company took just 25 days from sequence selection to vaccine manufacture. To draw a comparison, it took 20 months to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus that caused the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002-03 – merely for testing in humans. The pace of vaccine development was quick, but news of funding began to come in quickly too. For instance, in the third week of January, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations was roped in to fund the manufacture of Moderna’s vaccine. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) within the US Department of Health and Human Services came on board with a commitment of up to $483 million to push along the development of the potential vaccine. Later, Moderna also struck a deal with Swiss company Lonza to enable manufacturing of up to one billion shots at the dose level of 50 µg per year. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases conducted the phase 1 trial in the US. On 24 February, the first batch of mRNA-1273 was released for testing. The first of the 45 patients were given a shot on 16 March. Simultaneously, work was underway to manufacture more doses for potential future trials. On 12 May, Moderna received the ‘fast track’ designation from the US FDA for its potential vaccine. Positive preliminary results emerged from phase 1 almost a week later, with the mRNA-1273 eliciting neutralising antibody titer levels in the eight initial participants – four of whom received a 25 µg dose while the other four received a 100 µg dose. The phase 2 study, with 600 healthy volunteers in two age groups of 18-55 years and 55 years and above, got underway towards the end of May. On 14 July, the interim analysis of Moderna’s phase 1 study was published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The early results of the study showed rapid and strong immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 across all dose levels. Moderna has already advanced the late-stage development of its Covid-19 vaccine. Its phase 3 study protocol has been made known too and, according to the company, reviewed by the US FDA. “The randomized, 1:1 placebo-controlled trial is expected to include approximately 30,000 participants at the 100 µg dose level in the U. S,” revealed the company. At 100 µg, Moderna expects to deliver around 500 million doses per year, and “possibly up to 1 billion doses per year, beginning in 2021”, according to the company. Road Ahead The title of a 14 July editorial in The New England Journal of Medicine, “The COVID-19 Vaccine-Development Multiverse”, captures faithfully this exceptionally diverse vaccine work in progress simultaneously across the world. A vaccine usually takes 10 years to develop, according to the UK-based health research foundation Wellcome Trust. In light of this fact, the speed in the case of Covid-19 vaccine is clearly unprecedented, indicating a departure from the old paradigm. "

To understand this output, let integers be stored using 16 bits. In a little endian machine, when we do x[0] = 1 and x[1] = 2, the number a is changed to 00000001 00000010 which is representation of 513 in a little endian machine.    Segmenation fault:: Segmentation fault is a specific kind of error caused by accessing memory that “does not belong to you. ” It’s a helper mechanism that keeps you from corrupting the memory and introducing hard-to-debug memory bugs. Whenever you get a segfault you know you are doing something wrong with memory – accessing variable that has already been freed, writing to a read-only portion of the memory, etc. Segmentation fault is essentially the same in most languages that let you mess with the memory management, there is no principial difference between segfaults in C and C++. There are many ways to get a segfault, at least in the lower-level languages such as C(++). A common way to get a segfault is to dereference a null pointer: int *p = NULL;*p = 1;Another segfault happens when you try to write to a portion of memory that was marked as read-only: char *str =  Foo ; // Compiler marks the constant string as read-only*str = 'b'; // Which means this is illegal and results in a segfaultDangling pointer points to a thing that does not exist any more, like here: char *p = NULL;{  char c;  p = &amp;c;}// Now p is danglingThe pointer p dangles because it points to character variable c that ceased to exist after the block ended. And when you try to dereference dangling pointer (like *p=’A’), you would probably get a segfault.  void * type pointers cannot be de-referenced  #include&lt;stdio. h&gt;int main(){ int a = 12; void *ptr = (int *)&amp;a; printf( %d , *ptr); getchar(); return 0;}    Ans. Compiler Error   Increment the pointer or value?  int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; int *p = arr; ++*p;    Explanation: The expression ++*p is evaluated as  ++(*p)  . So it increments the value of first element of array (doesn't change the pointer p). When p += 2 is done, p is changed to point to third element of array.    "

    "body": "2020/07/24 - There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Markdown editor If you’ve gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown! As with the last post about the editor, you’ll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we’re using. Special formatting: As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:  strike through ==highlight== *escaped characters*Writing code blocks: There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks: . my-link {  text-decoration: underline;}If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.  Reference lists: The quick brown jumped over the lazy. Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference. Full HTML: Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here’s a standard YouTube embed code as an example: "

			<p>India’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) has launched a new feature for customers’ safety. Taking into consideration the rising incidents of ATM-related frauds. SBI will alert you by sending an SMS If you go to the ATM and want to check your balance or mini statement.</p>

<p>Amid the coronavirus pandemic, this facility will ensure curbing the ATM frauds which has been on a rise. The bank has alerted its customers to be cautious and not to ignore SMS alerts regarding balance enquiry or mini-statement when the request is not initiated by them.</p>

<p>SBI said in a tweet, “Now every time we receive a request for Balance Enquiry or Mini Statement via ATMs, we will alert our customers by sending an SMS so that they can immediately block their Debit Card if the transaction is not initiated by them”.</p>

<p>SBI has asked its customers to be alert and immediately notify the bank in case balance, mini statement requests were not made by them. “It could be a scammer’s attempt to check your bank account for the money. Immediately notify and request your bank to freeze your card,” SBI said.</p>

<p>Previously, to protect its customers from unauthorised transactions across all SBI ATMs, SBI had introduced cardless cash withdrawal facility. This new facility allows ATM cardholders to withdraw cash with the help of one-time password (OTP) and it has been active since the start of 2020.</p>

<p>SBI customers will have to provide OTP along with the Debit card PIN for cash withdrawal over Rs 10,000 between 8 pm and 8 am. The OTP-based withdrawal is not available at non-SBI ATMs.</p>

<p>SBI recommended that customers should conduct ATM transactions in complete privacy in order to avoid any ATM-cum-debit card fraud. SBI has revised its ATM withdrawal charges effective July 1. The bank has been giving tips to its customers on ways to keep their money safe.</p>
