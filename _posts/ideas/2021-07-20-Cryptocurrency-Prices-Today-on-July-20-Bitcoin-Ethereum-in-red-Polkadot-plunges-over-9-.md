Cryptocurrency prices continued to be in the red on July 20. The global cryptocurrency market cap was $1.23 trillion, a 4.34 percent decrease over the previous day, while the total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours was $57.25 billion, which makes a 16.38 percent increase.

The volume of all stable coins was $47.23 billion – 82.49 percent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. Bitcoin's price was $31,413.42 and its dominance is currently 46.79 percent, an increase of 0.63 percent over the day.

Days after Ethereum co-founder Jackson Palmer slammed the cryptocurrency industry in a series of tweets, another crypto entrepreneur and co-founder of Ethereum Anthony Di lorio has said that he is “quitting” the industry. The reason? Partially due to personal safety concerns among other things, Bloomberg reported.

The 48-year-old Canadian has had a security team since 2017. Di lorio said the crypto industry has a “risk profile I am not too enthused about,” adding: “I don’t feel necessarily safe in this space. If I was focused on larger problems, I think I’d be safer.”
