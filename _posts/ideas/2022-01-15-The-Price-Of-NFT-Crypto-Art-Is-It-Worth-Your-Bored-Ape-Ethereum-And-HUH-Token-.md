The Price Of NFT Crypto Art: Is It Worth Your Bored Ape, Ethereum And HUH Token?

Blockchain, the life and blood of crypto, has spun something that nobody realised would become such a valuable asset… NFTs.

Non-Fungible Tokens, among many things, but most importantly, offer the owner of the NFT a signature in its code… much akin to how you might sign a document or, even, a piece of beautiful art.

Because of this, it’s become more apparent that the likes of NFT technology have taken the form of digital art, wherein, creators are harnessing the immeasurable wealth afforded to digital art.

But, is this art worth your Bored Ape, Ethereum and HUH Token?

Let’s take a look at some of the top NFT artists at present…

PAK – The Unidentified NFT Artist

PAK, is one of the most spoken artists in the NFT art sphere, and rightfully so, the faceless and nameless creator(s) of PAK art have reimagined what could be next for the ever-present ethos of art.

PAK, having sold over 1,600 pieces of, notably to the one and only, Elon Musk, is quickly becoming one of the names that you have to check out.

Pak is most famous for their Instagram and Twitter accounts were simply viewing PAK’s masterpieces are free of charge.

So, if you’re looking to invest in NFT art, how much of your HUH Token, Ethereum or Bored Ape would it cost to attain one of these pieces?

The definite number can’t be known, as with all cryptocurrency affiliated technology, the price and value of PAKs art will fluctuate with the volatility of the market.

Though, from a glance at PAKs work, it’s clear to see that NFT art isn’t going anywhere, anytime soon.

Beeple – The First Of Its Kind Christie’s Sale

Beeple, was the first NFT artist to make a sale at one of the world’s oldest and most renowned art dealers: Christie’s.

Making a historic moment for NFT art and the art world in general as the piece ‘Every Day: The First 5,000 Days’ sold for over $65million.

Beeply, now solidified in the hall-of-fame of art, joined the greats and took its place in Christie’s history, which began in 1766.

This sale of NFT art not only goes down in the London-originated art dealers’ history but in art history as a whole, as the sale of the above-mentioned piece caused a ripple effect throughout the NFT art world and bought with it a new audience of classical art lovers. Meaning that these art pieces could be worth your Bored Ape, Ethereum and HUH Token after all… as history is not to be scoffed at.
