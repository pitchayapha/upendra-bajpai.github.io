Why did they sue Kim Kardashian and Mayweather Jr.? 1:02

(CNN) – Reality TV star Kim Kardashian and boxing legend Floyd Mayweather Jr are facing a lawsuit alleging that celebrities misled investors in their token promotion. Cryptocurrency.

The lawsuit, filed January 7 in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that celebrities have promoted tokens sold by EthereumMax, or EMAX, in order to increase their prices and make a profit “at the expense of their followers and investors.”

The lawsuit states that “the company’s executives, in conjunction with several celebrity promoters… made false or misleading statements about EthereumMax through social media advertising and other promotional activities.”

According to the indictment, Kardashian promoted EthereumMax in June 2021 on Instagram, when he had 250 million followers.

He wrote in the post “Do you like cryptocurrency?” , followed by a warning that “this is not financial advice” but wanted to share “what my friends just told me” about the EthereumMax tokens. He included the hashtag #AD to show that the post was paid advertising, according to the lawsuit.
