I heard the stories about crypto being able to offer me something that most people dream about, long-term investment, passive income, generational wealth … I listened to the rumour mill turn numerous times before I took it upon myself to conduct some reach into cryptocurrency and what, if anything, the digital currencies could do for me.

I found that Bitcoin, Shiba Inu and HUH Token had the most to offer me, in terms of potential long-term benefits from my crypto investments.

And though the dazzling lights of the crypto sphere shone in my eyes and the droll of fairground music played on loop in my head, I was finally able to construct a fully formed opinion on the three cryptos in this article.

I’ll show you what I discovered about long term investment with Bitcoin, Shiba Inu and HUH Token.

What You Need To Know: Crypto and Long-Term Investment

Bitcoin: Out of the three cryptos in this article, I had imagined that Bitcoin, the founding crypto of, well, cryptocurrency, was going to be the one and only choice for long-term investment because it’s stood the test of time.

However, it seemed that though many peoples Bitcoin had risen in value over the years, the crypto might not have planned as far into the future as the likes of Shiba Inu and HUH Token had.

I continued with my research, regardless, and discovered that long-term investors may have been one of many goals of Bitcoin, however, due to whale investors the currency’s value was too dependent on larger sums of money. Meaning, that I had little to no control over the increase and decrease of my investment with Bitcoin.

Shiba Inu: SHIB, the dog-faced cryptocurrency appeared a little-rough-around-the-edges when I first came across the currency, however, I swiftly changed my mind.

Shiba Inu knows how to harness the power of marketing and the influence of its holders and in doing so, potentially laid out a roadmap to the future right in front of my eyes. The creators Shiba Inu know that the people and marketing aren’t going anywhere, for a long time, and because of that, have made steps to bettering their ‘joke’ currency for holders.

In fact, before I became a holder, Shiba Inu made steps into the metaverse and bought me even closer to my dog-faced currency: SHIB.

HUH Token: HUH Token appealed to me, just as Shiba Inu had, except HUH’s roadmap was clear from the beginning, they intended to be crypto that could generate generational wealth and they’ve made countless attempts at making this so.

Currently, HUH Token will launch with hundreds of influencers, which will exponentially increase the value of the multichain currency, which can be purchased from exchanges like Bitrue.

HUH Token has also taken strides into NFTs which are the hot topic amongst crypto lovers, as, they show ownership of crypto… this has been most recently demonstrated in art works selling for millions.

HUH Token will drop its presale holders NFTs on the 31st of January, 2022.
