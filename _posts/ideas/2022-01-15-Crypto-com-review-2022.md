Crypto.com is going to be a good fit for cryptocurrency traders who are looking to trade one of the widest selections of cryptocurrencies in the industry. You’ll be able to trade well beyond the most popular cryptocurrencies, with more than 250 available. It will all be available to you through a slick mobile app that makes trading on the go easy. Like many other crypto platforms, customer service leaves something to be desired. With no customer service representatives available over the phone, you’ll have to rely on the FAQ page and online chat to get your questions answered.

Customers looking to trade more than just crypto will also be disappointed. If you’re ok with a more limited selection of cryptocurrencies to trade, you might be better off with Robinhood or Webull, where you’ll also be able to trade stocks and ETFs.

Pros: Where Crypto.com stands out

Cryptocurrency selection

Crypto.com really separates itself from other trading apps by offering more than 250 cryptocurrencies, among the best in the industry. Other cryptocurrency apps offer only the most popular coins, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and others. But with Crypto.com, you’ll find those popular cryptocurrencies along with more obscure ones like Polygon and Helium, as well as others you may have never heard of.

It’s worth noting that not all cryptocurrencies are available in every state, so be sure to check if a coin you’re interested in is available in your location before getting started. The Crypto.com app is not available at all in New York state.

Financial apps that offer trading in other securities along with crypto typically only offer a handful of coins. Robinhood offers commission-free trading in seven cryptocurrencies, while Webull offers more than 20 and says it is working to add more.

Coinbase is another option if you’re looking for a wide selection of cryptocurrencies, but with about 125 coins available it falls short of Crypto.com’s offering. Be aware that if you’re looking to trade non-crypto securities, you’ll need to open an account with a broker such as Schwab or Fidelity.

No fees on bank transfers

Crypto.com won’t charge you a fee to transfer money from your bank account to its platform, which makes it the ideal choice for funding your account. Other funding options, like using a credit card, come with fees of nearly 3 percent.

An automated clearing house, or ACH, transfer typically takes three to five business days and comes with a minimum amount of $20 and a daily limit of $100,000. You can also fund an account through a wire transfer, which is a bit faster at one to two business days but requires at least $1,000 to be transferred per transaction. The daily maximum for a wire transfer is $1,000,000.

Staking

Crypto.com allows customers to hold deposits of cryptocurrency with it and earn rewards in return. The practice, known as staking, is similar to a bank savings account that pays interest, but with significantly greater risks. You’ll be able to earn rewards on more than 40 different cryptocurrencies at Crypto.com and interest is paid weekly. As of January 2022, you could earn up to 14.5 percent a year by staking with Crypto.com. Staking with Bitcoin and Ethereum can earn up to 8.5 percent a year.

Remember that traditional bank accounts are protected by FDIC insurance, which allows you to recover up to $250,000 in the event of a bank’s failure. Crypto staking does not come with any similar insurance policy and you also face the market risk of losing your principal if the cryptocurrency declines in value.

Cons: Where Crypto.com could improve

Fees

Crypto.com comes in at the high end of the range for trading fees compared to other cryptocurrency exchanges. Most traders starting out will pay 0.4 percent on transactions, but that number does decline if you’re an active trader. Most other exchanges charge 0.2 – 0.35 percent and Binance.US comes in at just 0.1 percent.

Crypto.com uses a maker-taker pricing model that, at high volumes, rewards those that provide liquidity (makers) and charges a slightly higher price to those that reduce it (takers). Here’s a breakdown of how the fees change with increasing volumes.

30-day volume Maker Taker Less than $25,000 0.40 percent 0.40 percent $25,001 – $50,000 0.35 percent 0.35 percent $50,001 – $100,000 0.15 percent 0.25 percent $100,001 – $250,000 0.10 percent 0.16 percent $250,001 – $1 million 0.09 percent 0.15 percent $1,000,001 – $20 million 0.08 percent 0.14 percent $20,000,001 – $100 million 0.07 percent 0.13 percent $100,000,001 – $200 million 0.06 percent 0.12 percent $200 million and up 0.04 percent 0.10 percent

A discount of 10 percent is available for customers who stake CRO, Crypto.com’s own cryptocurrency, and pay trading fees in CRO. Other exchanges, including Kraken and Binance.US, don’t charge fees to makers once a certain level of trading volume is reached, but Crypto.com charges a small fee at even the highest volumes.

Educational material

If you’re new to cryptocurrency and are looking to learn more about it, you’ll need to go somewhere other than Crypto.com. While some questions are answered through the online help center, they’re mostly focused on how to perform different functions through the app, rather than educating traders about crypto.

Cryptocurrency has attracted many new traders, many of whom don’t understand how trading works or the many intricacies of crypto. Crypto.com has reportedly spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising, including a tv spot with actor Matt Damon and a naming rights deal for the old Staples Center in Los Angeles. Surely, it could invest some money into more educational content to help novice traders.

Customer service

Like many cryptocurrency trading apps, Crypto.com does not offer phone support as part of its customer service offering. You’ll have to rely on a help center that’s only available online and focuses more on account funding questions and certain product features. There is a chat option within the app for questions, but some customers prefer talking to an actual person on the phone.

Bottom line

Crypto.com gives traders looking for the widest selection of cryptocurrencies a solid option. You’ll be able to deposit funds from a bank account to the mobile app without paying a fee and you can earn solid returns through the platform’s staking program. Remember that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile and are a poor substitute for cash.

Trading fees are high, especially for customers who don’t plan on being active traders. Discounts are available if you plan to trade frequently. Crypto.com would also benefit from improved educational resources and a customer service option that includes talking to an expert on the phone.

For crypto-focused exchanges with lower fees, traders might consider Binance or Kraken. If you’re looking for just the most popular coins, general investing apps like Robinhood and Webull might be a better fit.
