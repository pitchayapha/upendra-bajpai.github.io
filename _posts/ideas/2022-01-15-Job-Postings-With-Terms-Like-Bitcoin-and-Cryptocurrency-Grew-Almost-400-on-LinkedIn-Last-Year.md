As the value of cryptocurrencies grew, so has the community surrounding the technology. People are asking for crypto gifts in their wedding registries. Investing clubs are growing more popular on college campuses, and students are increasingly interested in crypto. The mayors of Miami and New York City made headlines when they announced that they would take some paychecks in Bitcoin rather than dollars to boost the crypto industries in their cities. Some first-time homebuyers have even used proceeds from the sale of cryptocurrency investments to help fund down payments on houses.
