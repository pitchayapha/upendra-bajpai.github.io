Visa described that a path forward for small and micro businesses (SMBs) in 2022 includes “Going long on digital payments – even crypto.” The payments giant detailed:

Of those surveyed, 24% said they plan to accept digital currencies such as the cryptocurrency bitcoin.

The company elaborated: “An overwhelming 82% of SMBs surveyed said they plan to accept some form of digital option in 2022 and 73% see accepting new forms of payments as fundamental to their business growth.”
