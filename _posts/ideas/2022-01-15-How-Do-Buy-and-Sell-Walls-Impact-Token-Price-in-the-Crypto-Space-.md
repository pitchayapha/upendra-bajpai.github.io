Executing buy and sell walls are usually done by those with high net worth, better known in the ecosystem as “whales” with large holdings of several assets. This puts other holders in a slightly vulnerable position since they're at the mercy of large token holders selling a substantial amount to impact the token price.

A buy wall elicits the opposite response from a sell wall. The buy wall provides support to the asset's price instead of suppressing it.
