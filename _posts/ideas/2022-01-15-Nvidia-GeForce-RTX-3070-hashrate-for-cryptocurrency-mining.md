Looking for the 3070 hashrate? We’ve got it all here. The Nvidia RTX 3070 is a favorite among gamers, and for a good reason too. It packs more horsepower than a 2080Ti, and comes with extra RT cores under the hood to boost performance, which bodes well for its performance when mining cryptocurrencies. With several models of RTX 3070 having already been released, we look at if it brings the hash to earn you some non-fungible cash.

What is the hashrate of the RTX 3070?

The hashrate for the RTX 3070 is up to 62 MH/s while mining ETH. The hashrate for the RTX 3070 LHR is up to 45 MH/s. This nerf to hashrate is going to be standard for most brand-new RTX 3070 cards, meaning that it’s more likely that you will find the LHR model than the non-LHR model. However, be sure to keep an eye on reseller sites to get your hands on a non-LHR model, which is much more efficient. In addition to this, there are also several other models of 3070 such as the 3070 Ti and 3070 16GB.

We always base hashrates on Dagger Hashimoto values, mining Ethereum. This is because ETH is one of the most commonly traded cryptocurrencies, meaning that you could potentially make a huge amount of ETH with an RTX 3070. Be sure to correctly tune your miners to maximize the efficiency of your mining set up so you can reach profitability sooner. The 3070 is a fantastic mining card, and that means that everyone wants one, so it can be difficult to acquire.

RTX 3070 hashrate: what to expect

With a strong hashrate on normal and LHR models, the RTX 3070 can be considered one of the better price to performance options that you have in the current market. Additionally, there should be some consideration taken when it comes to how your configuration is set up.
