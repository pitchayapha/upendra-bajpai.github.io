Highlights Amazon India launches Watch Party for Prime Videos

The feature synchronises playback and lets you chat with your friends while watching movies or shows

Up to 100 participants can watch a video together in a session

Amazon Prime Video in India gets the Watch Party feature, which is similar to the Netflix Party extension. Only Amazon’s feature is not an extension but an option that can now be seen on the Prime Video website. Watch Party allows Prime members to stream movies and TV shows with their gang while staying apart at no additional cost. In a nutshell, the Watch Party feature will synchronise the playback on Amazon Prime Video that is controlled by the host. Up to 100 participants can watch a video together in a session, and they can communicate with each other via the built-in chatbox. That said, the Amazon Prime Video Watch Party feature is available exclusively for Prime members and works only on desktop.
