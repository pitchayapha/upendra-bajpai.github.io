Netflix appears poised to enter the gaming arena, after it announced earlier this week that it had hired ex-EA executive Mike Verdu to lead its expansion into the lucrative sector. While this could, potentially, be considered yet another headache for market leader PlayStation, it’s possible the Japanese giant could also see an opportunity here – and if images datamined from the streaming service’s app are to be believed, a potential partnership could be afoot.

According to dataminer Steve Moser, there are already video game references within the Netflix app’s source code, including a logo for a service called ‘N Game’, as well as assets for a couple of unbranded DualSense controllers and Ghost of Tsushima’s artwork. These could be errant leftovers from testing, but they’ve certainly fuelled speculation.

Sony, after all, is already in bed with Netflix, having signed a multi-year US licensing agreement which will see Sony Pictures Entertainment movies like Uncharted come first to the streaming service following their theatrical and home entertainment release windows.

There’s unlikely to be too much of substance here – Netflix’s venture into video games appears to be at a preliminary stage anyway – but it’s still fascinating nonetheless. Could Sony, perhaps, consider Netflix a valuable ally against Game Pass and other disruptive business models? It’s far too early to make those kind of calls, but it’ll be interesting to see how this story develops – especially as the media giant formulates its entry strategy into an extremely competitive market.
