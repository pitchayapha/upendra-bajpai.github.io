According to a tipster, who seems to have really good internal connections over at Samsung, has confirmed that the company is indeed working on a 600MP sensor. And to prove it, he has shared what seems to be a slide from an internal document or presentation. In short, we have a very good reason to believe the report.

To our surprise, the slide reveals quite a bit of information - from some key specs to the motivation behind the project. It says that due to the 4K and 8K video recording becoming more mainstream, Samsung wants to solve that with a bigger sensor, which allows for zoomed videos without compromising too much quality too.

The ISOCELL 600MP sensor, however, won't be coming soon because Samsung has to solve the issue with the camera bump first. A 1/0.57" big sensor would have to take roughly 12% of the phone's back panel and will protrude about 22mm. After all, we are talking about an enormous 600MP sensor with 0.8Âµm pixel size.
