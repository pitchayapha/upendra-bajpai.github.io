Xiaomi has earlier launched a smartphone, named Mi MIX Alpha that shook the whole smartphone world with its surrounded display design. This was not a regular call from Xiaomi to hit a mass-production of this device, it was just a concept then. It was reported as well that Xiaomi is looking to sell a limited quantity of smartphones in China.

Recently, Xiaomi has come up with a new patent that shows a similar smartphone like the Mi MIX Alpha with a surrounded display. But this time, it is expected to feature pop-up cameras. Let’s find out more about this.

Xiaomi has shared 16 sketches of the upcoming smartphone with its detailed design. Those images belong to a patent that was applied by Xiaomi back in April this year and got published on December 18, 2020.

Those 16 sketches show a complete 360-degree display of the smartphone. But apart from its surrounded display, its pop-up camera setup is likely to be a new highlight feature of this phone. The patent images show that this device will not have typical rear cameras, in place, it will sport a mechanized pop-up camera at the top which includes a triple rear camera setup along with Dual LED flash.

Regarding the ports and buttons, this upcoming Xiaomi smartphone features a power button on top as well as a secondary microphone. Similarly, at the bottom part of this phone, we find a speaker grille, primary microphone, 3.5mm audio jack, and a USB Type-C port. What it looks that this smartphone from Xiaomi will be the successor of the Mi MIX Alpha (developed under “Draco”). However, this smartphone was tipped to be powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 SoC chipset.
