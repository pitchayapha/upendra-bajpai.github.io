China’s reusable experimental spacecraft successfully returned to the scheduled landing site in northwest China on Sunday, September 6 after a two-day in-orbit operation.

The spacecraft was launched with an extended March-2F carrier rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China on Friday, September 4.

Spacewatch Pacific Asia quoted the Chinese Xinhua news agency as saying that the successful flight marked the country’s important breakthrough in reusable spacecraft research and is predicted to make round trips to the space low-cost and more convenient.

Industry experts speculate that the mission could be one of the most revolutionary milestones in China’s apparent efforts to develop a spaceplane capable of landing horizontally.
