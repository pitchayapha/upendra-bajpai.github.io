iQOO is reportedly readying to launch its iQOO 9 series of smartphones in the Indian market. A little while ago, we exclusively reported the launch of the iQOO 9 lineup for the country. Now, we have exclusive intel surrounding the potential pricing and specifications of the vanilla iQOO 9 for India. Turns out, the iQOO 9 India variant will be priced similar to the OnePlus 9RT , which launched today in the country. Moreover, instead of the flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC, the iQOO 9 India variant will be powered by last year’s Snapdragon 888+ SoC, among other changes. Let’s take a look at what the upcoming smartphone has in store for us.

iQOO 9 price in India and specifications

As per an industry source, the iQOO 9 will be priced similarly to the OnePlus 9RT. Therefore, we can expect the device to be priced in the Rs 42,000-45,000 range in the country.

Furthermore, the source tells us that the iQOO 9 India variant will come equipped with the Snapdragon 888+ processor, compared to the China version’s newer and more powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset. The SoC in both variants is paired with an Intelligent Display Chip, LPDDR5 RAM, and UFS 3.1 storage, along with up to 4GB extended/ virtual RAM. In the software department, the iQOO 9 will boot Android 12-based FunTouch OS 12 skin out of the box.

Coming to the display, the iQOO 9 Indian variant will feature a 6.5-inch 10-bit AMOLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate and a 1,000Hz touch sampling rate. The Chinese variant, on the other hand, features a 6.78-inch FHD+ AMOLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate. Owing to the AMOLED screen, both versions come with an under-display fingerprint scanner.

The device will feature a 48MP IMX598 main camera with Gimbal Stabilization support, a 13MP professional portrait lens, and a 13MP ultra-wide-angle camera. This is unlike the 50MP + 13MP + 13MP triple rear camera setup found on the iQOO 9 Chinese variant.

Coming to the battery of the device, the iQOO 9 Indian variant will feature a 4,350mAh battery with support for 120W fast charging over a USB Type-C charging port, which will charge the device from 0 to 100 percent in around 18 minutes. The fast charging speeds on the iQOO 9 Indian variant and the iQOO 9 Chinese variant are the same, but the latter features a slightly larger 4,700mAh cell. The device will be 8.63mm thick and will weigh in at 200 grams. The Chinese variant, on the other hand, measures 8.37mm and weighs in at 206.1 grams.

As of now, this is all the information that we have on the upcoming iQOO 9 Indian variant, but we are sure to receive more intel on the same in the coming days. Whenever we do, we will make sure to keep you posted on the same.
