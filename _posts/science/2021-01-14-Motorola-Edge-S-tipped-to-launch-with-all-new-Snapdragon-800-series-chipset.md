On Monday, Motorola teased a brand new Edge S device which will debut with an unnamed Snapdragon 800 series chipset. Back then, speculations pointed to either the latest Snapdragon 888 or last year’s Snapdragon 865 but now tipsterDigital Chat Station is reporting that this will in fact be an all-new chipset. We don’t get a specific name or detailed spec list.

One possible answer is the previously leaked Snapdragon chip codenamed “Shima”. It’s supposedly built on Samsung’s 5nm process and powered by a Cortex A78 main core clocked at 2.70 GHz. In addition, we’re expecting three more A78s working at 2.36Ghz as well as four Cortex A55 cores humming at 1.8GHz. The SoC is also said to feature an Adreno 660 GPU as well as LPPDR 5 RAM and UFS 3.1 memory support.
