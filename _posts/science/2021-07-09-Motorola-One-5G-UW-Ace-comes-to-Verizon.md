There’s a new and affordable 5G Motorola phone out on Verizon called the One 5G UW Ace. Yes, that’s a mouthful of a name but it’s been Verizon’s way of differentiating itself from the crowd. Spec-wise the phone is nearly identical to the Moto One 5G Ace launched earlier this year. The new device sports mmWave 5G connectivity and also debuts Verizon’s Adaptive Sound audio which is the carrier’s own spatial audio feature and a direct answer to the likes of Dolby Atmos and DTS:X.

The premise is that it can optimize sounds across all apps and media on your device including on your headphones without the need of any additional hardware or software and it should also arrive to older Verizon phones via software update.

Looking at the device specs we have a 6.7-inch FHD display with a centered punch hole cutout. There’s a 48MP main camera around the back next to an 8MP ultrawide shooter and a 2MP macro lens. The Snapdragon 750G chipset sits at the helm aided by 4GB RAM and 64GB expandable storage. Rounding out the spec sheet is a 5,000 mAh battery and Android 11 with Motorola’s My UX interface on top.
