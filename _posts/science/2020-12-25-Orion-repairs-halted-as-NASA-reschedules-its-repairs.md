People still stared at the sky at night and imagined space. Satellites were built in the second part of the 20th century, strong enough to conquer the gravitational force to achieve orbital speeds, leading the road to a possibility for space discovery. The Soviet Union had the opportunity to use long-range missiles as arms in the late 1940s. At the end of World War II, 200-mile V-2 rockets hit England over 3.500 with an hour at the height of 60 kilometers over the English channel. The USA and the Nazi Regime developed their separate ballistic missiles following World War II.

Throughout the sixties, the moon was observed and tested by autonomous aircraft before astronauts arrived. At the beginning of the 1970s, round-the-clock telecommunications and navigating spacecraft used to orbit and chart the Mariner spaceship. At the close of the decade, Voyager’s spaceship brought back accurate photos of the Outer Solar System’s orbits and moons. The scientific discovery of space covers places that were only dreamt of once. Mars is a priority of current space exploration, and the colonization of the crewed Mars is a lengthy US goal. NASA is on a mission to the Martian Surface in the 2030s to move people to it. NASA and its allies have conveyed the information on the earth with orbits, landers, and space probes. The Curiosity Rover has obtained astronaut emission data and will investigate the supply of oxygen and other Mars services at MARS 2020 Rover.

Despite the intention of Mars exploration, NASA halted Orion repairs that had recently finished the Artemis 1 mission. The concern was initially noted by The verge, who mentioned that the submissions by Lockheed Martin, the main contractor, warned of it being able to substitute the PDU for up to one year. The danger arises since the repairs are in the adapter in the crew capsule, and the service module is unreachable since both modules have to be connected. NASA confirmed the difficulties with the PDU on Nov 30.

The period estimation assisted the crew module being removed from the module operation, restored by the PDU, and reassembled and tested by the two modules. Substitute repairs could only be done in four months; however, the connector panels must be separated to access the PDU, not for the components. NASA failed to go into the reparation alternatives’ specifics in its announcement not to upgrade the PDU but claimed that the danger of losses to satellites in the PDU reconstruction was more significant than any data loss if the device interrupted functions.
