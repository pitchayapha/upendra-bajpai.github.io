What are the parameters to measure social progress? Most nations go by GDP growth, but are economic indicators enough? Not quite, according to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Solutions Network. The agency has been rolling out the World Happiness Report since 2012. This survey measures the well-being and progress of nations, but with a difference – namely, how happy are its citizens?

Denmark was the happiest country among 157 others in this year’s survey and has retained its spot in the top 10 since 2013.

But Indians are not so happy. We rank 118, in fact we toppled down a position. However, our Asian neighbours seem to be faring much better – China is at 83, Pakistan is at 92 and even Bangladesh is at 110.
