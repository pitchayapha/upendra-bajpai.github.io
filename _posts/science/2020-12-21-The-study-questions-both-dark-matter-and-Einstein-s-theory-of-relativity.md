The majority of astronomers believe they have a broad understanding of the energy and matter that make up the universe, but a small group of non-conformist researchers are not convinced. They say this means that the scientific community may need to rethink its position. According to accepted physics skeptics, rather than accept the existence of a proposed substance called dark matter, physicists must use new theories of motion and gravity to explain the cosmos. The general name of these new theories is, short for Modifications of Newtonian Dynamics. The general consensus among astronomers is that the matter in our universe is made up of two components: ordinary matter and dark matter. Ordinary matter is the familiar world of atoms and chemistry. Basically, that’s what we’re made of. is a substance that neither emits nor absorbs light, but experiences gravity. Although dark matter is invisible, scientists say dark matter is about five and a half times more common than ordinary matter. There is a huge amount of evidence to support its existence; for example, galaxies rotate so quickly that they should fly apart according to the accepted theory of gravity and the observed amount of stars and gas. Likewise, in galaxy clusters, which are groups of hundreds or even thousands of galaxies, the speed of galaxies is much faster than expected. Many other observations suggest that there is more matter in the universe than what we can see with telescopes. However, MOND members interpret these unexplained observations differently. They believe that a more reasonable explanation can be found by modifying either Newton’s law of motion or Einstein’s theory of gravity. The was proposed in 1983 by an Israeli physicist, when he refined Newton’s second law of motion. According to Milgrom’s theory, Newton’s law is correct for strong forces; however, for weak forces, the acceleration is stronger than expected by Newton. Another possibility is that Einstein’s theory of gravity is incorrect in the low gravity regime. It explored that perspective.

According to Forbes, “the study questions both dark matter and Einstein’s theory of relativity.”
