Highlights OPPO Reno5 Pro 5G India launch has been teased

The phone went official in China this week

OPPO Reno5 Pro 5G specs include the MediaTek Dimensity 1000+ SoC, 90Hz display, and 65W fast-charging support

OPPO Reno5 Pro 5G India launch has been teased by the company’s India R&D head Tasleem Arif. The handset, which succeeds the Reno4 Pro, debuted in China this week alongside the vanilla Reno5 5G. While Arif did not explicitly mention the Reno5 Pro, XDA-Developer’s Tushar Mehta had tweeted earlier this week that the model will likely launch in India in January. OPPO Reno5 Pro 5G specifications include the MediaTek Dimensity 1000+ SoC, OLED 90Hz display and 65W fast-charging support. It isn’t clear whether the model coming to India will be 4G or 5G, but our bet is on the latter considering MediaTek Dimensity-powered 5G phones are set to launch in the country in early 2021.
