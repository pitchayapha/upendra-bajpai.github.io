While India doesn’t have any 5G networks yet, Samsung has launched at least a dozen 5G smartphones in the country over the past year. Half of those were mid-range devices. It looks like the company will continue to launch more midrange 5G smartphones.

Three new Samsung smartphones, bearing model numbers SM-A336E/DS, SM-A536E/DS, and SM-M336BU/DS, were spotted in the BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) database. Going by these model numbers, we expect these phones to be named Galaxy A33 5G, Galaxy A53 5G, and the Galaxy M33 5G. All of them feature dual-SIM card slots.

The Galaxy M33 5G had recently appeared in Geekbench’s database with the Exynos 1200 processor. The Galaxy A33 5G might use the same chipset. The Galaxy A53 5G might come in Exynos 1200 and Snapdragon variants. The smartphone is also expected to feature a 120Hz Super AMOLED display, Android 12-based One UI 4.0, a 64MP triple-camera setup.

The Galaxy A33 is rumored to feature a 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display, 6GB RAM, an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, a 5,000mAh battery, and at least 15W fast charging. The Galaxy M33 5G might use the same display and processor as the Galaxy A33 5G, but it could use a bigger (6,000mAh) battery and faster charging (25W).
