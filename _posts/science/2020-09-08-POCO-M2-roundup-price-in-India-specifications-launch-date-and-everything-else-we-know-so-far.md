Highlights POCO M2 will be the cheapest phone from the brand yet

POCO M2 is confirmed to launch with an FHD+ display, 6GB RAM, and a waterdrop notch

The smartphone will be available via Flipkart in India

POCO M2 is scheduled to launch in India on September 8th and it is expected to be a stripped-down version of the POCO M2 Pro that was unveiled in the country back in July. The company has been teasing key features about the smartphone over the past few days, so we have a good idea of what to expect. POCO looks keen to expand its product portfolio, which is why the company is not only launching the POCO M2 in India next week but also the POCO X3 globally. We’ll talk about the POCO X3 another time. For now, here’s a quick look at everything we know about the POCO M2, from its expected price in India to key specifications.

POCO M2 price in India (expected)

POCO M2 price in India is speculated to be under Rs 10,000 for the base variant. Like the company’s other models, there should be multiple RAM/storage options for users to choose from. POCO claims the POCO M2 is the most affordable 6GB RAM phone, which suggests the variant will be priced around Rs 10,000, while a possible 4GB RAM model will be under Rs 10,000. POCO M2 is already listed on Flipkart and will go on sale on the e-commerce platform following the launch.

POCO M2 specifications

POCO M2 is confirmed to come with a Full HD+ display with a waterdrop notch for the selfie camera. The phone is confirmed to come in a 6GB RAM option, but there could be a 4GB RAM variant as well. There is no word yet on the storage options for the POCO M2. The POCO M2 is likely to run Android 10-based MIUI 12 with the POCO launcher on top. Standard connectivity features could include 4G LTE, dual SIM support, and GPS. Moving to optics, not a lot is known but we can speculate it may have multiple camera lenses. The young brand is also teasing a big battery capacity, but this information is still under wraps.

POCO M2 versus the competition

The POCO M2, when launched, will look to take on the latest Redmi 9 Prime that comes with a Full HD+ display under Rs 10,000. Assuming the POCO phone is priced around Rs 10,000, other rivals may include the Realme C15 and Samsung Galaxy M01s.
