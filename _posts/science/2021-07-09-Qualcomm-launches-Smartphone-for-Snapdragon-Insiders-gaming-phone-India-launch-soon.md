After months of speculation, Qualcomm finally launched its first smartphone, in partnership with Asus, called the “Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders”. Literally, this phone is for Snapdragon Insiders, a community of Snapdragon fans and enthusiasts who hear about new developments around Qualcomm’s mobile processors before anyone else. Essentially, this new gaming phone is a token of appreciation for the community. The Qualcomm phone is big on specifications, such as the Snapdragon 888 chip, 144Hz AMOLED display, and up to 16GB of RAM, to make for the gaming phone title.

The Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders is an out-and-out customised phone for people who know what they should have on their phone. This means the top-end processor from the company, but it is a bit surprising to see that Qualcomm did not go for the Snapdragon 888 Plus processor that it recently launched. Qualcomm said the development of this phone began last year, while the Snapdragon 888 Plus came through earlier this year. The Snapdragon 888 Plus is supposed to be a bit better in terms of handling graphics, but that is it. There is not much difference between the vanilla and the Plus variant. Yet, the company has a tier of processor higher than what this phone packs.

Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders price

The Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders costs $1,499, which is roughly Rs 1,12,200. There is just a single 16GB RAM and 512GB storage variant. The phone will go on sale in China, Germany, Japan, Korea, the US, and the UK initially by August. An India release will follow the first wave launch. The India price is not available right now. Even though the phone might come across as exclusive to the Snapdragon Insiders community, it will be available to purchase for everyone. The gaming phone is going to be available in a single Midnight Blue colour.

Qualcomm's Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders bundles a pair of truly wireless earphones with active-noise cancellation inside, called Master & Dynamic Earphones. Master & Dynamic is a New York-based audio brand. In the box, you also have a custom rubber bumper, which is essentially a rubber frame for the phone. There is a Qualcomm Quick Charge 5 power adapter and two USB-C to USB-C braided cables in the box.

Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders specifications

The Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders is a flagship phone, but it is also the chipmaker's first phone. Asus has helped Qualcomm bring this phone to reality. That is because Asus is among the leading brands for gaming phones. Its ROG Phone series is the best-selling gaming phone. It has a Snapdragon 888 chipset with Adreno 660 GPU inside. There is support for both mmWave and sub-6GHz 5G bands on the phone. The gaming phone has a 6.78-inch Full-HD+ AMOLED display with up to 144Hz refresh rate and 1,200 nits of peak brightness. There is support for HDR and HDR10+, while the display is shielded by a Corning Gorilla Glass Victus. There is 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 512GB of internal storage.

For photography, Qualcomm has used a 64-megapixel Sony IMX686 sensor on the primary camera, along with a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and an 8-megapixel telephoto camera. Qualcomm is touting its Qualcomm's Spectra 580 image signal processor will give better photos and up to 8K-resolution videos with the AI Zoom feature. On the front, the phone has a 24-megapixel camera for selfies and video calls. There are dual stereo speakers on the phone powered by Snapdragon Sound technology, along with four microphones on the phone. The Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders has a 4000mAh battery with Quick Charge 5.0 technology that can top it up in around 52 minutes.
