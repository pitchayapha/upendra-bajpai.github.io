NASA says the wildfires burning on the US West Coast are sending carbon monixide high into the atmosphere, with concentrations at least seven times the normal amount.

NASA released animation based on data sent by its Atmospheric Infrared Sounder aboard the Aqua satellite, which captured the plumes coming from California's wildfires.

The animation shows the three-day averages of carbon monoxide concentrations around three miles (five kilometers) up in the atmosphere between 6-14 September.

Red and orange areas indicate regions with concentrations of greater than 350 parts per billion by volume (ppbv), which NASA described as "extremely high".

The more normal, background concentrations of carbon monoxide show up as yellow and green, with amounts between 30 and 50 ppbv.

NASA explained that at the altitude mapped, carbon monoxide has little effect on the air we breathe.

But strong winds can push the gas downwards where it can affect air quality and play a part in climate change.

The wildfires in California have burned about 5,000 square miles (12,950 square kilometers), destroyed 4,200 structures and killed at least 24 people.
