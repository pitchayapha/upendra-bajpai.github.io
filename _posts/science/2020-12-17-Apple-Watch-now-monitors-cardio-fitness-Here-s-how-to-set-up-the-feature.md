Cardiorespiratory fitness is the ability of your body to transport oxygen to your muscles during workout.

Health has been Apple‚Äôs biggest focus ever since it launched the Apple Watch in 2015. Over the years, the Apple Watch has gained many new health and fitness features, including the ability to take an ECG measurement to measure blood oxygen levels. With iOS 14.3 and watchOS 7.2 updates, the Apple Watch has become ever more powerful. The smartwatch can now monitor your cardio fitness levels ‚Äì based on Vo2 Max. Simply put, the Apple Watch tells if your fitness is too low.

Before we tell you how to set up cardio fitness levels with your Apple Watch and iPhone, first understand Cardiorespiratory fitness. Well, Cardiorespiratory fitness shows how fit you are and how effectively your circulatory system sends oxygen throughout your body. Physical activity is a key behavior metric that can improve Cardiorespiratory fitness. CRF uses your V02 max levels to determine how much oxygen your body consumes during exercise or some sort of physical activity.

Apple Watch had the ability to measure VO2 max but with this update, the watch uses multiple sensors and special algorithms ‚Äî including the optical heart sensor, GPS, and the accelerometer, to estimate lower VO2 max levels.

The idea of monitoring your cardio fitness level through the Apple Watch is beneficial, as low CRF is a strong predictor of the risk of stroke, high blood pressure, and developing heart-related diseases in life. Generally, the higher your cardiovascular fitness level, the lower your chances of developing significant health issues.
