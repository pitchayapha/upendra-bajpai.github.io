The world of Cyberpunk 2077

Cyberpunk is a futuristic open-world, action-adventure game set in beautiful Night City. This city never sleeps, where people can replace their original limb with an artificial one. Well, there is a thrilling action at every corner of the city. The playerâ€™s main character is V, an outlaw who is hired specially to steal the special chip of immorality. Sounds super cool, right?

Originally released back in December 2020, Sony removed the game from the PlayStation store in a few days because of some complications and performance issues. After almost eight years of development and Keanu Reeves in the title role, the game was expected to be a blockbuster.

Instead, Marchin Iswiki (chief executive officer) was forced to apologize to the fans for all the issues and the inferior quality of the game. Now the game is back on PlayStation with a good level of performance. According to CD project CEO, now the developers can focus on other fixes. Cyberpunk 2077 sold nearly 14 million last year. However, this figure is not updated by the company.
