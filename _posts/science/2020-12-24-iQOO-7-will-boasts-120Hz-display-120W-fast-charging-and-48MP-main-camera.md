Last week we saw a certification listing about the upcoming iQOO 7 gaming phone which revealed a blazing fast 120W fast charging solution. Now, Chinese tipster Digital Chat Station revealed the device will also sport a 120Hz display with FHD+ resolution alongside a 4,000mAh battery with the aforementioned 120W fast charging all paired with Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 888 chipset. In addition, the blogger revealed the device is expected to release in mid-January



Digital Chat Station Weibo post

Earlier this week, the iQOO 7 was spotted in the hands of e-Sport gamers in the King Pro League (KPL) finals and iQOO’s official Weibo page revealed a BMW co-branded design just like on the iQOO 5 Pro sporting the German automaker’s blue and red accent colors. We can spot a large camera island on the back that appears inspired by vivo’s X50 Pro which is tipped to feature a 1/1.2-inch primary sensor with 48MP and OIS.

The iQOO 7 series will debut a new version of iQOO UI based on vivo’s OriginOS. It’s still not clear if the series will make its way to global markets after its predecessors remained exclusive for the Chinese market.
