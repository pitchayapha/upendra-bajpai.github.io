New updates are being added at the bottom of this story…….

Original story (published on August 08, 2020) follows:

Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Note 20 and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra at a Galaxy Unpacked 2020 event on August 5. The event also welcomed the Galaxy Tab S7 and Galaxy Tab S7+, Galaxy Z Fold2, Galaxy Watch3, and Galaxy Buds Live, but one thing stood out for sure, at least for software update fans.

At the event, Samsung revealed that the Galaxy Note 20 will receive three Android OS updates all through to Android 13. That’s some feat coming from Samsung, which has been offering two OS updates to all Galaxy devices regardless of the price.

This changes going forward. And even better is that the Galaxy Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra aren’t alone. If you own any of the devices in the Galaxy S20, Galaxy Note 10 and Galaxy S10 series, you are also guaranteed at least three Android OS updates.

Yes, this means OS updates for the Galaxy Note 10 and S10 series wont stop at Android 11, rather, Android 12 is also on the cards. But until then, lets talk about the latest offering from Samsung – the One UI 3.0 update based on Android 11.

Regular PiunikaWeb readers probably have come across our list of Samsung Galaxy devices we think will receive the One UI 3.0 update. With new devices still expected in the near future, this list should keep growing.

But of course, not all eligible devices will be upgraded to Android 11 at the same time. Typically, premium models in the Galaxy S and Note series get the nod ahead of the midrange and budget devices in the Galaxy A and Galaxy M series.

In this article, we keep track of all Samsung Galaxy devices that have picked up the One UI 3.0 update based on Android 11 so far, beta or stable. As usual, we will keep this article updated with the latest news whenever a new Galaxy device bags the new OS.
