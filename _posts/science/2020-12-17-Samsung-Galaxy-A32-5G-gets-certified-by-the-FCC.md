Samsung's upcoming Galaxy A32 5G is likely to be the company's cheapest 5G smartphone ever. We've already seen the future affordable device in leaked renders, and so we know what it looks like. Now the FCC has certified it, and this gives us some details about its specs and features.

First off, it will ship with a 15W charger in the box. The model that was certified is SM-A326J, and this specific variation comes with support for 5G bands 28/77/78. There's also NFC support on board.

The Galaxy A32 5G will have a 6.5" display with a waterdrop notch, and a glossy plastic finish. On the rear there are three cameras (48 MP main) and an LED flash, as well as an unknown sensor (or perhaps a fourth shooter). The phone measures 164.2 x 76.1 x 9.1 mm, and it will have a fingerprint scanner embedded into the power button and is likely to run Android 11 from day one.
