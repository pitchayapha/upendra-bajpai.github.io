iQoo is teasing the arrival of a new Z-series handset in India. This is largely anticipated to be the iQoo Z3 smartphone that was launched in China. iQoo Z3 is a successor of the iQoo Z1 and iQoo Z1x and it comes with a triple camera setup on the back. The phone features a 120Hz screen refresh rate and is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 768G SoC. There is a waterdrop-style notch at the front and a side-mounted fingerprint sensor as well.

The company tweeted from its India handle to announce the arrival of a new Z-series handset. There's an image with a faint Z in the background, possibly hinting at the arrival of iQoo Z3. The phone was launched in China in March and it is now anticipated to launch in the Indian market. iQoo India has not announced an exact launch date but it is slated to be coming soon.

iQoo Z3 is likely to be priced in the same range as its China variant that starts at CNY 1,699 (roughly Rs.18,900). In China, the phone was launched in Cloud Oxygen, Deep Space, and Nebula colours and the same options should be made available in India.

At the front, there is a notch housing a 16-megapixel selfie shooter. iQoo Z3 is backed by a 4,400mAh battery with support for 55W fast charging.
