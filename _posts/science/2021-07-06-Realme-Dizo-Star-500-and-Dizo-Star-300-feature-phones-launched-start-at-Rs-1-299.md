Realme’s sub-brand Dizo on Monday launched its first feature phones in India, marking the company’s foray into the low-cost feature phone market. The two phones, Dizo Star 500 and the Dizo Star 300 bring features such as a T9 keypad, a torch, and support for Indian languages. Dizo’s new phones take on Reliance Jio’s JioPhone. The JioPhone is carrier-locked but brings 4G connectivity to feature phones, as do a wide range of phones from brands such as Nokia. Dizo, however, has only 2G connectivity on the two new phones.

According to a report by CMR Mobile Handset Market released back in February, India’s overall feature phone market saw a 2 per cent increase in shipments year-over-year and leading the market in the fourth quarter of 2020 was iTel, a brand of Transsion Holdings that also owns Tecno and Infinix smartphone brands. In the second spot was Samsung, while brands such as Lava, Micromax, and LG also managed to secure their position in the top five. JioPhone, which reignited the sales of feature phones in India back in 2018, faded in sales because customers preferred features such as loudspeakers and long battery life over things such as 4G.

Taking a cue from this market trend, Dizo’s new phones do not bring 4G onboard. The Star 500 and Star 300 phones come with dual-SIM cards and both of them support just 2G, which means you will be able to choose any mobile operator for services, except for Jio. Jio is a 4G-only network, which is why phones without 4G support cannot support it. It is also why the JioPhone exists in the first place because Jio’s network cannot be used on non-4G feature phones.

Realme Dizo Star 500 and Dizo Star 300 price

The Dizo Star 500 costs Rs 1,799 while the Dizo Star 300 price is Rs 1,299. Both the feature phones will go on sale on Flipkart soon. Dizo is yet to make a formal announcement on the sale date.
