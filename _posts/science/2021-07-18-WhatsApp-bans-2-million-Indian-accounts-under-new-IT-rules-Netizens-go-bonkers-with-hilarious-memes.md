“Our top focus is preventing accounts from sending harmful or unwanted messages at scale. We maintain advanced capabilities to identify these accounts sending a high or abnormal rate of messages," the company said. "Majority of users who reach out to us are either aiming to have their account restored following an action to ban them or reaching out for product or account support," it added. The Facebook-owned social media platform reportedly also said that the abuse detection method works in three stages—during registration, while messaging and in response to negative feedback from user reports and users blocking an account.
