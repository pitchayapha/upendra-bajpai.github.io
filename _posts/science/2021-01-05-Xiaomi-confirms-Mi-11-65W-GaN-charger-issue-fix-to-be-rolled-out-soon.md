Xiaomi recently launched its latest flagship smartphone — Mi 11, which went on sale a couple of days ago. Apart from being the first phone in the world to come powered by the SD888 chipset, it is also the company’s first smartphone to come without a charger.

As the company is not offering a charger in the box, some users are using the Mi 65W GaN charger that the company sells separately, to charge the phone. However, many of them are reporting an issue.

Although the charger was withdrawn from sale in China a few months ago, users who had purchased it prior to that are using it to charge the newly launched Mi 11. But on connecting that charger, the phone reboots and enters into an infinite loop cycle.

Zhang Guoquan, Director of Xiaomi‘s Mobile System Software Department has said in a Weibo post that the company’s engineers have obtained the charger creating the issue. After analysis, the team found that the problem is with the specific model and batch of the charger because of the charging compatibility conflicts.

The Chinese company is now expected to push out an over-the-air (OTA) update that will fix the issue with the Xiaomi Mi 11 smartphone getting affected by the 65W GaN chargers. However, as of now, there is no timeline for this fix.
