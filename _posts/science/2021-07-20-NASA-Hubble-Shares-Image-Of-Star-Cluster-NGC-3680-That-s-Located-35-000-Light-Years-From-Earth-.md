The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) recently shared an image of a star cluster in this #HubbleFriday image. This star cluster is known as NGC 6380 (NGC = New General Catalogue).

As reported by NASA, this cluster is located 35,000 light-years from Earth, though the very bright star at the top of the image is a lot closer at only 4,000 light-years away. The image has been shared by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope official Instagram account where it has gathered over 80,000 likes and 234 comments.

The caption for the image shared on Instagram states, “The star cluster in this #HubbleFriday image has been known by many names: Dun 538, H 3688, and Pismis 25. Why? Different astronomers “rediscovered” it multiple times. But these days, it’s known reliably as simply NGC 6380 (NGC = New General Catalogue)”. Check out this stunning image:

The caption further adds “NGC 6380 is a globular cluster, which is a spherical group of stars bound together by gravity. Globular clusters often contain some of the oldest stars in their galaxies! This cluster is located 35,000 light-years from Earth, though the very bright star at the top of the image is a lot closer at only 4,000 light-years away".

According to NASA, it was originally discovered by James Dunlop in 1826, and he rather immodestly named it Dun 538. Eight years later, in 1834, it was independently rediscovered by John Herschel and he (similarly immodestly) went on to name it H 3688. The cluster was re-rediscovered in 1959 by Paris Pişmiş, who catalogued it as Tonantzintla 1 – and who, to continue the pattern, also referred to it as Pişmiş 25.

In addition to its colourful history of rediscovery, up until the 1950s NGC 6380 was thought to be an open cluster. Nowadays, this cluster is reliably recognized in widely available catalogues as a globular cluster and referred to simply as NGC 6380.

NASA Hubble recently also shared an image of a, which is classified as a flocculent spiral galaxy because it doesn’t have clearly defined arms. It is located about 26 million light-years away and is found in the constellation Leo.
