In Liaoning province, local farmers found dinosaur remains in an underground burrow, the postures of which suggested that they were buried alive during hibernation. Paleontologists who examined the samples concluded that the reptiles, which were 1.1 meters long, were representatives of the species of early ornithopods. They moved on their hind legs and had a duck beak. It is possible that the animals ran quickly over long distances, since they have powerful hind legs and a long elastic tail, as well as burrowing holes, as evidenced by a short neck and forearms, strong shoulder blades and an upper part of a shovel-like muzzle.

In the gastrointestinal tract of one of the individuals, experts found a handful of small stones, which she intentionally swallowed to quickly crush food during digestion. Ornithopods led a herbivorous lifestyle. The new species was given the name Changmiania liaoningensis, which translated into Russian means “eternal sleeper from Liaoning.”

Earlier, archaeologists have found ancient Russian graffiti with a mysterious creature in the Pereslavl-Zalessky Cathedral.
