The caption for the image states, “Time for a quick astronomy lesson! ✏️ A “galactic bulge” is a densely packed region of stars at the heart of a spiral galaxy. They often host supermassive black holes! This Hubble image shows the galaxy Caldwell 40's bright centre, which is its galactic bulge. Caldwell 40 is 70 million light-years from Earth and located in the constellation Leo”. Check out this stunning image of Caldwell 40:

According to NASA, Caldwell 40 (NGC 3626) is a spiral galaxy that’s best viewed during Spring, is magnitude 10*, and can be viewed with a small telescope. For the uninitiated, scientists have used Hubble to observe the most distant stars, galaxies and planets in our solar system. Hubble's launch has been marked the most significant advance in astronomy since Galileo's telescope.
