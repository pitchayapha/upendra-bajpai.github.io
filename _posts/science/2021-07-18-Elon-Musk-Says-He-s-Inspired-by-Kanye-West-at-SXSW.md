Elon Musk may be an innovator and icon for several South by Southwest festival attendees, but the engineer and tech magnate made it clear who he turns to for inspiration -- and it's one of the best in the rap game.

Musk has been publicly singing Kanye West's praises for years: He gushed about West's penchant for pushing boundaries and constantly going back to the creative drawing board for Time's annual list of influential figures, the Time 100, in 2015, but brought his appreciation into a current focus at a SXSW Q&A on March 11 when he revealed who revs the engine of his metaphorical Tesla.
