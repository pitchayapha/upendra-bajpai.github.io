Labor Day has arrived, and with it the unofficial kickoff of the fall season (it officially doesn't start until September 22), which means we're about to see lots of deals and new products make their way to stores. Many retailers are celebrating the holiday with some Labor Day sales. Labor Day promotions tend to revolve around things like mattress deals or meal delivery discounts, but you can find some pretty sweet tech and gaming deals as well. Best Buy and GameStop just kicked off their Labor Day sales as well, offering discounts on bunch of PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch games. Most of these deals run through the end of the day, so make sure you take advantage of them while you can.
