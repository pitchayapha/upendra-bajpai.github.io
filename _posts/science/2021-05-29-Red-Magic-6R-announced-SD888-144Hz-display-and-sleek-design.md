Back in March, Nubia unveiled the new contenders for its Red Magic series in the form of Red Magic 6 and Red Magic 6 Pro. These devices were true gaming smartphones with a huge focus on hardware. They came with high-refresh-rate screens and Snapdragon 888 to give users the best possible performance for gaming. As usual, we also saw the gaming-centric design approach that has been characteristic for devices of this kind. Today, the company is introducing a new variant dubbed Nubia Red Magic 6R. It brings the very same Snapdragon 888 alongside a gorgeous 144Hz display, however, its design is more on par with traditional smartphones. Without further ado, let’s dive into the specifications introduced by this new gaming contender.

Nubia Red Magic 6R specifications

The Nubia Red Magic 6R flaunts a gorgeous 6.67-inch AMOLED display that offers FHD+ resolution with 2,400 x 1,080 pixels. The display offers a 20:9 aspect ratio, 144Hz refresh rate, and has 770 nits peak brightness. Interestingly, Nubia brings an adaptive refresh rate, so the refresh rate can dynamically switch between 30Hz, 60Hz, 90Hz, 120Hz, and 144 Hz. This will help to conserve battery life while you’re using apps that do not necessarily require a high refresh rate. The smartphone also comes with a 400Hz single finger touch sampling rate and a 360Hz multi-finger touch sampling rate.

Under the hood, the Nubia Red Magic 6R boasts Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 SoC. The almighty processor comes in multiple variants with 6GB/8GB/12GB RAM. As we can see the 16GB option is not available here, but 12GB is still overkilling for most of the tasks we can perform in a smartphone. The device has 128GB or 256GB UFS 3.1 storage. In the software front, it runs Android 11-based Redmagic OS 4.0 straight out of the box.

Just like other gaming smartphones, the Nubia Red Magic 6R has a dual shoulder button to enhance the gaming experience and the feeling in certain games. For options, the company brings a capable Quad-Camera setup. It comes with a 64MP primary camera from Sony, an 8MP 120-degrees ultrawide camera, a 5MP macro snapper, and a 2MP depth sensor. For selfies and video-calling, the smartphone has a 16MP camera with an f/1.8 aperture. The device has an in-display fingerprint scanner and also boasts stereo speakers for an enhanced experience.

In terms of dimensions, the Red Magic 6R is quite sleek. The device measures 163.04×75.34×7.8mm and weighs about 186 grams. In terms of connectivity, the handset has dual-SIM support, 5G NSA/SA, Dual 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 6E 802.11 ax, Bluetooth 5.1, GPS + GLONASS, and a USB Type-C port. The Red Magic 6R draws power from a 4,200mAh battery that offers 55W fast charging. This is the smaller battery in the lineup, but the fast-charging capabilities may compensate
