In a major feat, home-grown smartphone maker Lava International has developed the world's first customisable smartphone called 'MyZ', which would be available for purchase starting 11 January, reports Economic Times.

The indigenously developed customisable smartphone would allow the users to choose the components like front and rear camera, memory (RAM), storage capacity (ROM) and colour on their own from the company's official website. It would offer 66 such combinations to the users.

Lava's president and business head Sunil Raina emphasised that the launch of the customisable smartphone would give the users the freedom of choice based on what they think suits their usage. He also added that the users would be able to customise and upgrade their smartphone at any time based on their need.

Raina noted that the entire programme is an outcome of the work by Indian talent.

The development comes as Lava International is aiming to acquire a five per cent share in the market this year with a new product portfolio. The company had recently unveiled its first phone which has been designed by its engineers in India.

Lava International claims to have a manufacturing capacity of 4 crore feature phones and 2.6 crore smartphones per annum.
