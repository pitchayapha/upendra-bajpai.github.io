Last week, iQOO revealed the rear design of the upcoming iQOO 7 flagship smartphone. It showcased a special BMW edition of the phone featuring a white leather-like rear with blue and red stripes on the right. The handset was also seen sporting a triangle-patterned triple camera setup housed inside a rectangle module. A reliable tipster from China claimed that the iQOO 7 may launch by mid-January.

The tipster claimed that at least four Snapdragon 888 powered flagship phones will debut in China before the Spring Festival that will fall on Feb. 12. It can be said based on the recent reports that China may receive SD88 powered phones like the Samsung Galaxy S21 series, Xiaomi Mi 11 series, Vivo X50 Pro+, and iQOO 7 before the Spring Festival.

It is speculated that an iQOO phone with a V2049A model number that was recently approved by the 3C authority of China could be the forthcoming iQOO 7 phone. The listing had revealed that it may ship with a 120W fast charger.

The tipster who tipped the mid-January launch for the iQOO 7 had previously claimed that it will be arriving with a flat display and a battery that is slightly bigger than the iQOO 5 Pro It is likely that the iQOO 7 may feature a display with a top-centered selfie camera cutout like the upcoming Vivo X60 series.

At present, there is no concrete information on the camera specs of the iQOO 7. The iQOO 5 Pro came with a 50-megapixel Samsung GN1. The leakster claimed that the iQOO 7 may feature a different main camera.
