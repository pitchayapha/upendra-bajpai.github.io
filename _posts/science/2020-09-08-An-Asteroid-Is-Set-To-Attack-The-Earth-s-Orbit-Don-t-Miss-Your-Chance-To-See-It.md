An asteroid, twice the size of the Pyramid Of Giza, is set to hit the Earth’s orbit on September 6. This asteroid named 465824 (2010 FR) was first discovered in 2010 and likely to posses no harm to anyone.

NASA

NASA ( The National Aeronautics and Space Administration ) has been tracking this gigantic asteroid for a while now, and it is said to be between 120 m and 270 m diameter.

This asteroid was discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) on March 18, 2010, and has been under surveillance since.

And NASA let the world know about this asteroid by tweeting,

“Our #PlanetaryDefense experts are not worried about asteroid 2010 FR, and you shouldn’t be either because it has zero chance of hitting Earth. It will safely pass by our planet on September 6 more than 4.6 million miles away—that’s more than 19 times the distance of our Moon! “

More Asteroids

It is considered as Near-Earth Objects which means these asteroids come closer to Earth but won’t cause any harm and move on in their way.

After this six more asteroids are expected to travel near Earth.

NASA says several asteroids may pass by Earth on September 8,12, 14, 17 and 20. It is notable that on September 1 and 2, two different kinds of asteroids were also noted.
