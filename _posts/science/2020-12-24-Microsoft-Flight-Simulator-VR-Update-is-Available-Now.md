We talk a lot in gaming about realism and realistic graphics. As much as people love these elements of a game, nobody is giving Microsoft Flight Simulator the credit it’s due. I understand and accept that it’s not a game for everyone. Still, the accuracy and authenticity of the flying experience are unmatched in the gaming world. There’s a reason so many use this as a tool to help train pilots in real life. The most exciting update to the game, Microsoft Flight Simulator VR, is finally here. If you wanted to fly a plane, then this is about as close as you can get to the real thing. Make no mistake, this VR update isn’t just a gimmick. Microsoft went above and beyond to include this feature in the game. Plus, it’s heading to consoles in 2021.

The Amazing Accomplishment of Microsoft Flight Simulator VR

One need only watch a little of the preview video Microsoft uploaded to see how incredible the Microsoft Flight Simulator VR update truly is. The realism of the game is unmatched. If you aren’t quite sure about this game actually being a video game, then I understand your holdup. This is a simulation game to the fullest, most real extent. The recent VR inclusion is only going to further that claim. The only difference now is that many with VR hardware are going to see just how beautiful the game truly is.

A huge element of the ambitious project was the promise of VR. When VR capabilities got announced this summer, I sort of thought it would end up getting a delay into 2021. Now that it’s here, the feature promises to be an additional selling point to one of 2020’s most underrated games. The goal, of course, isn’t just to provide VR, but to provide it to as many people as possible. The free update is “compatible across a wide range of supported devices, including most Windows Mixed Reality headsets (including the HP Reverb G2), Oculus, Valve, and HTC headsets.”

Is This the VR Experience Gamers are Waiting For?

Other than Half-Life: Alyx, I’d argue that most VR games seem like experiences you can get away without playing. Valve put incredible work into their game, which is why Alyx made many GOTY lists despite most of us not playing it. Microsoft equally deserves praise and credit for getting VR support to Microsoft Flight Simulator. The game itself is less exciting than the prospect of what VR could mean for gaming. We see the technology increasing in prominence and performance. For the most part, however, many are waiting to pick up VR hardware until something demands their attention. I think Microsoft Flight Simulator could be that game.

Of course, if you’re still not sure, then consider the fact that it’s free for Game Pass subscribers. If you subscribe to Game Pass for PC or Game Pass Ultimate, then it’s waiting for you now. Console players can expect the console version on Xbox Series X/S later down the road in 2021. Would you consider trying this game out in VR? If so, then let us know in the comments.
