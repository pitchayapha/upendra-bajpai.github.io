After remaining inactive in 2019, POCO returned as an independent brand last year. The company unveiled a wide range of phones such as the POCO X2, POCO F2 Pro, POCO M2 Pro, POCO M2, POCO X3, POCO C3, and POCO M3 in 2020. While POCO fans eagerly waited for the POCO F2, the company did not reveal anything on its arrival. It now appears that the launch date of the POCO F2 may not be far away as the company has officially teased its arrival in a new tweet.

The stage is set! The fun has begun! Let us get ready to take it to the next level! Excited? You should be, coz the next year is going to be even crazier. While we enjoy, let us look back at everything we've achieved together! Thank you ❤️ pic.twitter.com/K0432jSj8B — POCO India (@IndiaPOCO) December 31, 2020

Through a new tweet, the company looked back at what it achieved in 2020. It sold over 1,000,000 POCO phones last year and ranked no. 4 in the list of online smartphone brands in India. The company aims for bigger achievements in 2021. It can be said based on recent reports that apart from phones, the company will launch other products like TWS and laptops in 2021.

At the end of the tweet, it teased the POCO F2 while thanking its fans. Here is the screenshot that teases the arrival of the POCO F2.

There is a possibility that the POCO F2 could be one of the first POCO phones to debut in 2021. Folks at Xiaomi Telegram (unofficial) group (via) have shared the key specs of the POCO F2. It is advisable to digest the specs leak with a pinch of salt as there is no confirmation of its authenticity. While the POCO F1 was an ultra-cheap flagship phone powered by the Snapdragon 845 chipset, the new leak states that the POCO F2 is a mid-range phone.

POCO F2 specifications (Unconfirmed)

According to the leak, the POCO F2’s model number is K9A and it is codenamed as Courbet. It will be equipped with an AMOLED screen that delivers a refresh rate of 120Hz. The leak screen size is not mentioned in the leak. A 4,250mAh battery will back the device, and it will come with support for reverse charging. Its global variant will support NFC connectivity.

The rear-facing quad-camera setup is expected to come with usual lenses such as wide, ultrawide, macro, and depth. Their configurations are not known yet. Lastly, the phone will draw power from the Snapdragon 732G, which is the same chipset that fuels the POCO X3.
