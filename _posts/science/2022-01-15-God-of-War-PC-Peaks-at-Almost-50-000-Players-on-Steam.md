God of War has got off to a strong start on PC storefront Steam, where it peaked at almost 50,000 players earlier in the day. This, to be clear, is concurrent users based on Valve data – it means the title has presumably sold significantly better, of course, as not everyone will be playing at the exact same time. The title already has over 1,800 user reviews at the time of writing, with fan feedback Overwhelmingly Positive.

Sony has attracted plaudits for the PC version of its flagship franchise, which first launched on the PlayStation 4 in 2018. By all accounts it’s a stunning re-release of a contemporary classic, with plenty of fancy new features and great compatibility across the board. Since a slightly shaky start with Horizon Zero Dawn, the platform holder has been getting rave reviews for the care and attention it’s been putting into its PC conversions.

It’s worth remembering that God of War is also available on the Epic Games Store, so it’ll have sold a handful of copies there as well. At the time of typing, though, there are more people playing God of War on Steam than evergreens like Dead by Daylight, Warframe, and Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six: Siege. Obviously this is a single player title so the interest will tail off in the coming months, but clearly this will prove a shrewd investment from Sony’s hierarchy in time.
