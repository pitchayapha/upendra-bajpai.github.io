The ASUS ROG Phone 3 that debuted in July has a model number of ASUS_I003D. A new ASUS phone with a similar model number ASUS_I005DA has appeared on Geekbench. Also, the ASUS_I005DA and ASUS_I005DB model numbers have appeared at the HTML5 test page. The newly spotted phone could be the successor to the ROG Phone 3.

Ideally, the successor model of the ROG Phone 3 should have an ASUS_I004D model number. However, instead of the number “4”, the model number has “5” in it. This suggests that it may break cover as the ROG Phone 5.

Various smartphone OEMs are known for skipping the number “4” in the model numbers and monikers of their devices as it is considered a bad omen in some Asian countries. It is advisable to wait for further reports to know whether the ROG Phone 3’s successor will be called ROG Phone 4 or ROG Phone 5.

The ROG Phone 4’s Geekbench listing reveals that it is powered by a Qualcomm chipset, which is codenamed Lahaina. The codename is associated with the Snapdragon 888 5G mobile platform. The SoC is coupled with 8 GB of RAM and it is preloaded with Android 11 OS. In the single-core and multi-core tests of Geekbench 5, the handset scored 1081 and 3584 points, respectively.

The ROG Phone 2v was announced in July 2019 and it was replaced by the ROG Phone 3 in July this year. Hence, it is too early to talk about its successor model.
