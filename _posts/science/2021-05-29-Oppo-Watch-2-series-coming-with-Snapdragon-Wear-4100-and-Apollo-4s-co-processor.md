It seems Oppo is finally ready to offer a successor to last year’s Oppo Watch. The brand took to Weibo to tease its Watch 2 series. The official teaser hints at longer battery life and an announcement scheduled for the second half of this year.

A separate leak from a Chinese tipster offers more in-depth information about the upcoming Watch 2 series. We should expect two sizes just like last year’s models with 42mm and 46mm diameters both powered by the Snapdragon Wear 4100 platform alongside a custom Apollo 4s secondary chipset. The Watch 2 series is expected to offer ColorOS for Watch based on Android Oreo 8.1 alongside a secondary real-time operating system (RTOS) for extended battery life.

Other specs include eSIM with LTE support and 16GB onboard storage. There’s a new Oppo Relax app as well as all-new watch faces and a reworked stress detection app. The tipster also mentions the possibility of an ECG version launching later on.
