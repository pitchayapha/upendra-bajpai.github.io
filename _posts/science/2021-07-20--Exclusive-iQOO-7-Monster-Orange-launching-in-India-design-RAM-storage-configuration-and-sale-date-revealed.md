Although we don’t have information regarding the iQOO 7 Monster Orange price in India, we can expect it to cost the same as the other two colour options.

Coming to the design, the iQOO 7 Monster Orange is painted in the same orange colour that you see in the logo of the brand. It is worth mentioning that the orange colour is just limited to the back panel of the smartphone. The frame of the device has not been colour matched to the back panel. Instead, it is painted in silver colour. The phone has ‘Monster’ written on its back panel, boasting the powerful hardware of the device. The iQOO 7 Monster Orange is undoubtedly an eye candy and should attract many people.
