Warhammer: Odyssey

Price: Free to play

Warhammer: Odyssey is a new MMORPG set in the Warhammer universe. The game boasts six classes, 12 specializations, and the usual assortment of MMORPG social elements. In terms of game play, it’s a solid, if somewhat typical, MMORPG experience. You run around, complete quests, kill bad guys, and progress through the story. There are also decent graphics and easy controls so it doesn’t take long to learn how to play. There are a few bugs as is the norm for new games, but most of them are minor things the developer should be able to clean up quickly enough.

Google Pay

Price: Free

Google officially launched a completely redo of its Google Pay app. It began work in November and the full version is available now. The app still has most of its original features. However, it puts a much larger emphasis on sending money to and from people similar to Venmo or Cash App than it does for NFC payments. Thus, the whole UI is different to accommodate that new focus. You can’t send money on the web anymore, which is a shame. However, you can scan your Gmail and Google Photos data for receipts for some cash back options if you want to. It’s better in some ways and worse in others, just about as you would expect.

Abyss: Rebirth Phantom

Price: Free to play

Abyss: Rebirth Phantom is an idle RPG. Players embark on a quest to another world and adventure while they play. The idle portion of the game is basically auto-battling. You’re really supposed to just sit and enjoy the game while you grind up and summon characters. However, the game does have a few flaws. The English localization is below average with obvious grammatical errors. Plus, the summoning system seems to be a bit messed up for some folks. It definitely needs some fixes, but has some promise for fans of the genre.

Flexcil

Price: Free

Flexcil is a note taking app mixed with a PDF reader. The app started its successful life on iOS and should launch officially on Android soon. The app lets you read, annotate, and organize your PDF files. You can also organize and check out other types of documents and notes. It’s a fairly powerful app overall with a bunch of different features that almost all revolve around organization, PDFs, and taking notes. It’s in beta right now and you can hit the button below to sign up for the beta version. Just be prepared for bugs because it is a test version.

Blade & Soul: Revolution

Price: Free to play

Blade & Soul: Revolution is a new MMORPG from Netmarble. This one actually has quite a bit of promise. The graphics are pretty decent and there are a lot of things to do. It features a more intricate combat style although you can just auto-battle if you want to. It even includes faction wars with up to 500 players on each server. Otherwise, it has a solid MMORPG foundation with plenty of ways to customize your character. It’ll be up to Netmarble as to whether this one succeeds, but it has a good base so we hope they build on it properly.
