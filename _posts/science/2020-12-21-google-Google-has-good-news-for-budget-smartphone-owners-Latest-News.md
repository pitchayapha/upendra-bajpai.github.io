Internet search giant Google has rolled out a new feature for the Google Camera Go app, the camera app that the company offers for entry-level devices. The app, which was launched earlier this year in March for handsets that run on the Android Go edition operating system, now comes with HDR support after the latest update.This was confirmed by the company through the official Android account on Twitter. “Camera Go keeps getting better. We’re bringing HDR to more Android devices, allowing you to capture photos with crisper details and richer color at any time of day,” reads the tweet.The feature should be rolled out with the next OTA update of the app.Back in October, Google rolled out Night Mode to the Google Camera Go app, allowing Android Go smartphones to allow users to capture high-quality photos in low-light and without flash support.For those unaware, the Google Camera Go app is a toned-down version of the Google Camera app and is aimed for handsets that run on the Android Go edition operating system. For those unaware, the ‘Go edition’ of Android is supposed to bring entry-level smartphones running 2GB RAM or lower to the latest version of Android without them having to wait for long.For those unaware, the Go edition of Android was first introduced in 2018 and with the launch of Android 11 (Go Edition) in September, it was claimed by Google that the handset will now offer 20% faster loading time for apps as compared to how they opened on Android 10 (Go edition).
