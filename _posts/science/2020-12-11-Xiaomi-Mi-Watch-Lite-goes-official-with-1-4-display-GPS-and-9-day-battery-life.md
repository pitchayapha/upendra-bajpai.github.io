Xiaomi has introduced a new smartwatch dubbed Mi Watch Lite, which is based on the Redmi Watch that was launched in China last month.

The Mi Watch Lite sports a 1.4" color touchscreen of 320x320 pixel resolution, which has auto brightness adjustment and a pixel density of 323 ppi. The smartwatch supports over 120 watch faces, with some of them letting you choose the information you want to see on the screen.

The Mi Watch Lite comes with an automatic step counter and supports 11 workout modes, which include Outdoor Running, Outdoor Cycling, Indoor Cycling, Treadmill, Open Water Swimming, Pool Swimming, Freestyle, Cricket, Trekking, Trail Run and Walking.

Additionally, the smartwatch comes with sleep tracking, heart rate monitoring and guided breathing, which should help alleviate your stress levels. The rest of the features of the Mi Watch Lite include incoming call, SMS and app notification alerts, music control, idle alerts, phone finder, and weather report.

The Xiaomi Mi Watch Lite also has GPS on board, which is something the Redmi Watch has missing. In addition to GPS, the smartwatch also comes with GLONASS and a Barometer.

Powering the entire package is a 230 mAh battery, which is claimed to offer up to nine days of autonomy. And once it's completely drained, you can fully charge it with the bundled dock in two hours.

The Xiaomi Mi Watch Lite is offered in three watch cases and five straps - Pink, Ivory, Black, Navy Blue, and Olive.

Xiaomi hasn't revealed the pricing and availability details of the Mi Watch Lite yet, but considering the CNY299 price of the Redmi Watch that translates to $45, you can expect the Mi Watch Lite to carry a similar price tag in global markets.
