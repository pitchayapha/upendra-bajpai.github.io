DxOMark just published its full camera review of last year's vivo X70 Pro, which we found to be among the best cameras in the market. DxOMark's rating aligns with this az the handset got an overall score of 131 points sharing its 12th place with the Oppo Find X3 Pro and the vivo X50 Pro+. Interestingly enough, that puts it one place above the iPhone 13, 13 mini and 12 Pro Max.

The reviewers liked the accurate exposure, vibrant colors, excellent detail in low-light scenarios, the proper white balance on the ultrawide camera and the effective video stabilization. On the other hand, the review findings suggest that there's noticeable clipping of fine detail in some scenarios, a little bit of noise in both day and night, color fringing on the ultrawide camera (this is a common issue, by the way) and the loss of focus and detail in low-light video scenes.
