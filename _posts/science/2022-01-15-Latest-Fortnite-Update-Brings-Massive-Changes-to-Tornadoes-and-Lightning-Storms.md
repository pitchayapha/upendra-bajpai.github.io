Different types of storms in Fortnite Chapter 3 Season 1

Different types of weather in Fortnite, such as tornadoes and lighting, were released during Chater 3 Season 1. Just like the wildlife in Chapter 2, this weather adds to the appeal of the game. Chaotic tornadoes to destructive lightning, both of these can be beneficial for players, but that comes with a cost.

Both lightning and tornado are perfectly visible from afar so you can prepare yourself accordingly. Basically, you have 2 options, either avoid the conditions or travel towards it to take advantage of the different effects. Tornadoes are bigger and more dangerous than lightning. Lightning, for the most part, comes from grey clouds while, on the other hand, tornadoes travel around the island.
