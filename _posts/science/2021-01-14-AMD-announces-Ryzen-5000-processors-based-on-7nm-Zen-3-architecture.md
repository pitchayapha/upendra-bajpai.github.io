AMD has been gaining momentum in the market and in a bid to capture more market share, the company has announced its new Ryzen 5000 mobile CPUs during its keynote at the virtual CES 2021.

While making the announcement, Lisa Su, CEO of AMD claimed it to be the “most powerful PC processors ever built.” Some models of the new chipset are based on 7nm “Zen 3” architecture while some are based on the older Zen 2.

The company has divided the processors into two categories — H-series which is aimed at gaming and content creation, and U-series which is aimed at ultrabooks. The H-series models are based on Zen 3 architecture while the U-series have Zen 2 architecture.

Both the categories have four chipsets — Ryzen 3, Ryzen 5, Ryzen 7, and Ryzen 9. The high-end offering in the H-series is the AMD Ryzen 9 5980HS that has eight cores and 16 threads, offering a 3.0GHz clock speed that can be boosted up to 4.8GHz.
