High-quality images of a spiral galaxy codenamed NGC 2835, whose appearance resembles the “ominous eye” located in space, have recently been published on the website of the Hubble orbiting telescope. This picture turned out to be so atmospheric that the specialists involved in the administration of the resource called it “Image of the Week”.

Galaxy NGC 2835 is a spiral cluster of stars with a bar; by the way, the Milky Way, in which the solar system is located, belongs to a similar group of galaxies. This galaxy has a whole set of bright stars that cross its territory in the central zone, which creates a visual effect in the form of an “ominous eye”. By the way, the galaxy itself is located 8.75 Mpc from Earth in the direction of the constellation Hydra.

In the images obtained by the Hubble telescope, the galaxy really resembles an “ominous eye”, as if peeping out of deep darkness at the very heart of the universe. At the same time, in the central part of NGC 2835 one can see the presence of a supermassive black hole, which is also a characteristic phenomenon for such objects. Moreover, the mass of this black hole exceeds the mass of the Sun by several million times, reports Planet Today.
