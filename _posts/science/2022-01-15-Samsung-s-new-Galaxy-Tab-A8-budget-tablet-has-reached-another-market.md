Samsung’s new mid-range tabled, the Galaxy Tab A8, is available in Thailand starting today. Prospective buyers can pick from two color options: gray and pink gold. The tablet is available with Wi-Fi-only connectivity and LTE.

The Wi-Fi-only Galaxy Tab A8 will set you back 9,990 baht ($300), while the LTE model is available for 10,990 baht ($330). Customers in Thailand can buy Galaxy Tab A8 from Samsung’s online stores, as well as physical Experience Stores, and through participating retail partners.

Galaxy Tab A8 quick overview

Samsung’s new budget tablet isn’t all that different from the previous model. The Galaxy Tab A7 and Galaxy Tab A8 are very similar. The latter model is equipped with a UNISOC Tiger T618 chipset rather than a Qualcomm SoC, which suggests that the Tab A8 was born out of the global semiconductor shortage.

The Galaxy Tab A8 may not be an upgrade over the previous model, but it remains a decent low-cost tablet for customers that don’t already own the Tab A7. The Galaxy Tab A8 has a 10.5-inch FHD display and a 7,040mAh battery. It ships with Android 11 and One UI 3.5.

Although the Galaxy Tab A8 doesn’t have S Pen support, Samsung has created another entertainment-focused tablet with stereo speakers, Dolby Atmos, and enough processing power to handle most tasks with relative ease.
