Google is finally rolling out Apple Music support on Google Assistant-enabled devices. This includes all the Google Home/Nest branded smart speakers from Google as well as other manufacturers.

Apple Music subscribers will be able to link their account with their Assistant-enabled device through the Google Home app on their phone. Once that's done, you can just use your voice to play any track you like from Apple's 70 million track library. This also includes any playlists or liked songs that you may have associated with your Apple Music account.

We first reported Apple Music support on Google Assistant-enabled devices last year when it suddenly showed up within the Google Home app. It was later discovered that this was just a 'bug' and the feature was since removed. Until today, 22 months later, when it has resurfaced in official form.

Apple Music will be rolling out to Nest and other Assistant devices in the US, UK, France, Germany, and Japan today. There's no information yet on when this feature will be available in other regions.
