House cleaning is seemingly common everyday business, but it can be harmful to human health. As well as things that we use every day in everyday life.

How to properly clean the house for the benefit of yourself and your loved ones, and what everyday habits can inflict an inevitable blow to the human body, have been found out in the program “Ranks with Ukraine”.

How to clean your health

For example, a detergent sprayed on the surface of furniture creates a thin film invisible to the human eye, which is like a magnet for dust and dirt – everything adheres to it much faster. And applying the product to a napkin reduces concentration. Also, this method is considered safer for the human body.

“Small particles that hang in the air for a long time are toxic irritants, because they are chemical structures. They can irritate the mucous membranes of the nose, bronchi, and eyes,” says allergist Elena Bachinskaya.

Vacuuming does not mean cleaning. If you have a regular vacuum cleaner and do not clean the bag after each cleaning, then it becomes a pathogen of ticks and infections. And the longer the vacuum cleaner is with a dirty bag, the more hazardous substances it gets.

“When you turn on the vacuum cleaner again in a week, it will blow out the smallest microscopic particles that cannot be retained by filters with a powerful jet. And then they will hang in the air for a long time, because they are very small and light,” says the doctor. , then you should give preference to wet cleaning. And it is better to choose a vacuum cleaner that will filter the debris through the water. That is, you vacuumed, poured water, and it costs clean. ”

How to clean your health

Making the bed is the last thing to do in the morning. After all, after waking up, dirt remains on it, which the human eye does not see. You need to wait a little until the bed cools down and ventilate the room. “Each of us exfoliates 3-4 million epidermal cells every hour,” explains the allergist. “This is the main breeding ground for house dust mites.”

Also, do not leave wet terry towels in the bathroom. This is because they become a favorable environment for the spread of fungal infections. Therefore, these towels should be changed every two days. And for the face it is better to use disposable in general.

Another tip is not to keep the curtains open all the time in summer. This primarily concerns people who have rooms on the sunny side. If you want the furniture and the floor to stay presentable for as long as possible, you should close the windows with curtains or blinds during daylight hours. Due to the high amount of UV radiation, furniture and wood floors can quickly lose their color.
