It has been rumored that the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra smartphone will sport a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC for all regional models. This would mean that the Exynos 2200 variant, which could have headed to potential customers in Europe and Korea, may have been canceled. The Galaxy S22 series is expected to be launched on February 8 or 9.

Rumors are flying thick and fast in regard to the Galaxy S22 and Samsung’s Exynos 2200 chip. Hot on the heels of a poll that revealed most users would prefer a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 in their S22 over an Exynos 2200 part comes a claim that buyers of the S22 Ultra model won’t have to concern themselves with chip choice anyway. According to tipster Ahmed Qwaider the “Exynos 2200 copies were canceled” and “Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 for Galaxy S22 Ultra will come in all countries of the world”.

It is worth keeping in mind that the same source actually earlier stated that there were no problems at all with the Samsung/AMD chip and that “officially, the Galaxy S22 Ultra will come with an Exynos 2200”. Of course, information can change and leakers will count on numerous sources, often providing conflicting details. However, these claims come just over a day apart from each other. Qwaider has mentioned that the information received simply changed from one day to the next, and even Ice universe has chimed in with the comment “European Samsung users will be too excited to sleep tonight”.

While some outlets have proclaimed that all Galaxy S22 units will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, the post from Qwaider clearly only mentions the S22 Ultra. So, it is possible that the Exynos 2200 might still make an appearance but in the lower-specced models of the series. Interestingly, a report from LetsGoDigital back in November 2021 stated that the Exynos 2200 would not feature in the Galaxy S22 series at all. Obviously, none of this is for certain until Samsung issues an official statement, but it does seem for the moment that the Samsung/AMD collaboration may have not yielded the rewards that were hoped for by either party.
