Xiaomi is finally set to bring the Mi Mix series back to the limelight with the Mi Mix 4, and it appears that the company may already have the phone geared up for imminent release.

According to information coming out of China, Xiaomi is set to launch the Mi Mix 4 in August. The Mi Mix line has offered Xiaomi's experimental phones and the Mix 4 will be no different, with the source tipping it to sport an in-display selfie camera in an attempt to deliver a completely unblemished display. In addition to that, the Mi Mix 4 is said to be powered by the Snapdragon 888+, Qualcomm's latest and greatest chipset.

The flagship phone is expected to deliver a massive 100 W fast charging—no surprise as we already saw 120 W charging on the Mi 10 Ultra last year. According to Gizmochina, the Mi Mix 4 will use a FHD+ AMOLED made by Chinese company Optoelectronic, that display is likely to either be a 90 Hz or 120 Hz panel as is the norm these days. All of that ensures the Mi Mix 4 will carry a heavy price tag, with sources claiming it could be pricier than the €1,199 Mi 11 Ultra.
