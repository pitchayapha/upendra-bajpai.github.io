Xiaomi keeps on introducing new features and improvements with its beta program which is also focused on the Android 11-based MIUI 12 updates now.

Devices including the Mi 10 series, Redmi K30 Pro, and Redmi Note 9 Pro (India) have already bagged the Android 11-based MIUI 12 stable update.

However, Xiaomi’s beta program is still on in China and its members keep on getting regular updates with many enhancements.

Now, the MIUI System Launcher app has received another alpha update with a new search box to add Gaussian blur on Android 11 and much more.

The download link for the latest alpha update is given below for manual installation. However, some of the features might not work with Android 10 as they are limited to the latest OS update.

MIUI Alpha Launcher Update V4.22.0.2607-12021143: Link

6. New search box to add Gaussian blur effect on Android 11 (temporarily supports Mi 10/Pro;

7. Fix the problem that the recent task card is displayed in white after rotating.

While the Icons section UI in the MIUI System Launcher settings has been slightly tweaked, upcoming updates might bring a whole new option.

There is the new Select style and adjust size option which currently allows only icon size adjustment but future update might bring the ability to choose from different icon styles as well.

However, it is unclear when the aforementioned feature will be made available as the OEM has not made any announcements on the matter.

Also, the icon style feature will first be made available on the beta channel so it might take a little too long before it hits the stable channel.

Nevertheless, it is still good to see that Xiaomi is steadily improving the user experience on its in-house custom skin while also focusing on the latest OS update.

That said, we will bring more such updates once new information becomes available so stay tuned to PiunikaWeb.
