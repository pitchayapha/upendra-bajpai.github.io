Apple is aggressively pushing users with devices running iOS 14 to upgrade to iOS 15. This is different from Apple's earlier stance for iPhones and iPads running iOS 14.

When iOS 15 was launched, Apple announced that it was offering iPhone and iPad users the choice between iOS 14 and iOS 15, promising updates to those that chose to stick with iOS 14. But that seems to have suddenly changed.

What changed for Apple?

With the launch of iOS 15.2, Apple has removed the optional footnote at the bottom of the "Software Update" section on any iPhone and iPad running iOS 14. If that weren't enough to signal a change in stance, Apple has also stopped releasing security updates for iOS 14.

Apple's messaging is clear: Want to stay safe and get regular updates on your iPhone/iPad? Upgrade to iOS 15. The clearest example of this is how most iPhone that still run iOS 14.8 are no longer being offered iOS 14.8.1 update, but are instead being asked to directly upgrade to iOS 15.2.1.

While it's unclear why Apple is pushing the iOS 15 software update so fiercely, it seems that it has something to do with low installation rates of iOS 15 - so far installed on 72% of Apple devices bought in the last four years. While this may seem like a good percentage, it's lower than previous update installation rates for iOS.

The numbers for iPad OS are much worse for iOS 15 adoption, jeering at a dismal 50%. For perspective, iOS 14 was installed on 81% of iPhones released prior to December 2020.

For security reasons, we suggest all iPhone and iPad users to upgrade to iOS 15 as soon as they can, for it appears that Apple is in no mood to let you use older iOS versions.
