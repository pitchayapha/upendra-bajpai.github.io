Almost every new smartphone that has been launched in the last few years comes with dual-SIM support. The feature allows you to use two different numbers on the same device. Unfortunately, one of the most popular messaging platforms globally,

, does not allow you to use two different accounts on a single device. To use multiple WhatsApp accounts on a single smartphone, most

users opt for ‘Dual WhatsApp’ by using the app cloning feature. Few users even install third-party apps to use two WhatsApp accounts. But no such features are available for

users.

Thanks to WhatsApp’s sibling app, WhatsApp Business, you can use two different WhatsApp accounts on a single iPhone. WhatsApp Business app is similar to the regular version but it gets a few more features that makes it suitable for business owners. WhatsApp currently allows you to use these two versions of the platform with two different numbers on a single device.
