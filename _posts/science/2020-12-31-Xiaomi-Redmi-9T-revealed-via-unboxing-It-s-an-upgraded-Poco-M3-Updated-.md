The all-new Redmi 9T has been revealed via an unofficial unboxing video.

This is essentially a mildly upgraded version of the Poco M3.

The video has since been pulled from YouTube.

Update: December 31 2020 (3:30 AM ET): It looks like the third-party unboxing video has been pulled from YouTube. Nevertheless, you can read the original article below for the Redmi 9T details.

Original article: December 31 2020 (1:35 AM ET): 2020 has seen the newly independent Poco brand release tweaked versions of existing Redmi phones, with the Poco X2 originally released as the Redmi K30 4G and the Poco F2 Pro previously launching in China as the Redmi K30 Pro.

Now, it looks like it’s Redmi’s turn to ape Poco, as the hitherto-unseen Redmi 9T has made an appearance in an unofficial unboxing video on YouTube. The video, by veteran tech journalist Myriam Joire, shows off a phone that’s essentially a Poco M3 with a few tweaks. Check it out below.

Probably the biggest change is in the camera arena, as the Redmi 9T offers a 48MP quad rear camera setup with a newly added 8MP ultra-wide camera. This is a noteworthy change from the Poco device, which offered a disappointing 48MP triple camera setup (main/depth/macro).

We also see a tweaked camera housing (see main image), as the Redmi device ditches the Poco M3’s distinctive camera housing in favor of a more traditional bump.

Otherwise, Joire notes that the Redmi 9T has the same specs as the Poco phone. That means a 6.53-inch FHD+ LCD screen with a waterdrop notch, a Snapdragon 662 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, a huge 6,000mAh battery, and a side-mounted fingerprint scanner. Don’t expect NFC support though, much like the Poco device.

We’ve asked Xiaomi to clarify pricing, availability, and specs in general, and will update the article when we hear back from them. Nevertheless, the Poco M3 is already available in the likes of Europe, but it hasn’t hit India yet. So presumably the Redmi 9T is coming to the latter market in lieu of the Poco device.
