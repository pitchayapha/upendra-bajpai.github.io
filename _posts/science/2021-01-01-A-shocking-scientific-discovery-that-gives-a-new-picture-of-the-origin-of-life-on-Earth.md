The study, published in the journal Angewande Chemi, suggested that the trace element was D-ammonium. Earth Before the advent of life, he called the tiny units of DNA “dioxy nucleosides”.

After the chemical bonding process took place, things known in the scientific environment emerged With DNA Neanderthal, or early form of DNA on Earth.

This discovery is one of many other similar discoveries in recent years, amid evidence that DNA and the chemically closest element “RNA” have evolved into secretions together. For chemical reactions Is similar.

This scientific conclusion means that the two molecules that work to copy the first formula for life on Earth are a combination of the two, namely DNA and RNA.

Researchers believe that this important scientific discovery could lead to the emergence of new practical applications in the fields of chemistry and biology, but the most important thing is to paint a picture of the origin of life on Earth.

On the other hand, this scientific discovery will lead to more specific studies to find out how the communication between DNA and RNA occurred and how it spread to Earth in its primitive form, before it became a stage of biological maturation that appears in our present life, through bodies and materials. .

Ramanara Yana Krishnamurthy, a chemical researcher at the Skyrips Center, said the latest discovery was an important step in developing a detailed chemical model of how life on Earth evolved.

This scientific conclusion shatters an idea that has been around for decades, with molecular duplication or reproduction processes initiated by RNA, while DNA appeared and was later fabricated depending on the organism thanks to RNA.

Researcher Ramanarayana Yana Krishnamurthy and his colleagues suspected that it originated from RNA, for the simple reason that its molecules were too sticky and did not allow this property to repeat itself or reproduce on its own.

Scientists explain that the RNA component can attract other individual “building blocks” of DNA, which then attach themselves to each other and integrate with each other.
