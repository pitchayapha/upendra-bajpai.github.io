Battlefield 2042 will be another addition to the immensely popular Battlefield franchise. A gameplay trailer for the game saw its release at E3 2021. Gamers seemed exultant since the game would finally give them an alternative to Call of Duty. And thus, the gameplay trailer was greeted with explosive exultance. And Battlefield 2042 suddenly found itself having become one of the most awaited video games releasing this year.

If the game doesn’t look like much right now, there’s no need to worry. This is pre-alpha footage, and the actual game might look a lot better. Before the game comes out, there’ll also be Alpha and Beta tests that the game will go through. And also, a handful of people will get the chance to participate in these tests. Needless to say, DICE will try to keep things on the hush-hush.

Battlefield 2042: alpha test

The alpha test was revealed to be July early last month. The exact date for the test is not known yet. But it is expected to take place in the first half of this month. And any long-term player of the Battlefield games can be part of it. There’s not going to be an elaborate eligibility test, and who gets to participate will be based on luck. DICE will send out emails at random to some of the most dedicated players of the franchise, and only they will get be part of the test.

And again, DICE does not want information about their exciting upcoming release to get out. This means that the chosen few, who will get to participate in the alpha matches, will most likely not find out anything about what the world (in the game) looks like. Most textures will be censored. But then again, video game information leaking right before the release of a game is not completely unheard of.

Battlefield 2042: beta test

No dates for the beta test for Battlefield 2042 have been announced so far. But rest assured, for it will surely happen before October. But it is unlikely to be July since July is already getting the Alpha test. And there’s more good news about the beta test! The test will be inclusive of all major platforms. Meaning, the test will be available on both current-generation Xbox consoles X and S as well as Xbox One consoles. Sony’s PlayStation also gets similar treatment, and players with either a PS5 or PS4 can participate. And it goes without saying that PC players will also get to be part of the beta test.

By the looks of things so far, DICE seems to be doing well. They’ll be hoping the tests go as expected so ensure the game releases on time.
