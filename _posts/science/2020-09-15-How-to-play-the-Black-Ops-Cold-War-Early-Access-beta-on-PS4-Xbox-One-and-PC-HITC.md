The multiplayer for Call Of Duty Black Ops Cold War was revealed yesterday, and it will have a traditional mini-map plus a new 40-player mode. It certainly looks exciting as ever, and the good news is that fans will be able to experience it before the game’s launch via Early Access and open beta. Here you’ll discover how to play Black Ops Cold War’s multiplayer beta and Early Access on PS4, Xbox One, and PC.

In addition to bigger maps and new modes, the release of Treyarch’s newest instalment will also significantly change Warzone. Fans still have Season 6 of Modern Warfare and Warzone to anticipate, and this is scheduled to happen on September 30th which isn’t too far off.

Then, after the launch of Warzone Season 6, fans will be able to play the Black Ops Cold War Early Access and multiplayer beta on PS4, Xbox One, and PC. With first dibs for Sony gamers.

How to play Black Ops Cold War Early Access beta

The Early Access beta for Call Of Duty Black Ops Cold War begins on October 8th-9th for PS4 users only, and you must pre-order any edition to participate.
