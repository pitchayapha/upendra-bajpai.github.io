Xiaomi just launched the new Xiaomi Mi 11: the first-ever flagship equipped with the new Snapdragon 888. But despite having the best chipset in the Android world, the Mi 11 is still a flagship killer sold at a very interesting price tag. Besides the Mi 11, two more flagships went official in the last days of 2020: the OPPO Reno5 Pro+ and the Vivo X60 Pro. In this comparison, we decided to compare the specifications of the best Android flagships released from Chinese brands in the last part of 2020 in order to let you understand which one is the most interesting handset you can actually buy without spending a huge amount of money.

Design

The Xiaomi Mi 11 has a very original and beautiful design. With its camera module boasting rounded corners and a very high screen-to-body ratio, it is definitely an attractive phone which tries to differentiate itself from the concurrence. But the OPPO Reno5 Pro+ is my favorite one for a simple reason: its electrochromic body. Its rear side is able to change its color with a simple double tap on it, and this is an amazing feature in terms of design. The Vivo X60 Pro still comes with a beautiful design and premium materials, but I personally prefer the OPPO Reno5 Pro+ and I think a lot of people will agree with me.

Display

The Xiaomi Mi 11 is equipped with the most advanced display: for the first time, Xiaomi opted for a display with a Quad HD+ resolution. The display of the Xiaomi Mi 11 has a 120 Hz refresh rate and the HDR10+ certification, as well as a very high brightness up to 1500 nits. The display received an A+ from DisplayMate and it is actually one of the best panels out there. But the OPPO Reno5 Pro+ is not joking with its 90 Hz AMOLED display, and neither the AMOLED panel of the Vivo X60 Pro. Further, all the phones feature an in-display fingerprint scanner.

Hardware/Software

If you want the most powerful smartphone, you must go for Xiaomi Mi 11. It is the first and at this moment the only phone fueled by the Snapdragon 888 mobile platform: the latest and most powerful SoC by Qualcomm. The phone also offers up to 12 GB of RAM and up to 256 GB of UFS 3.1 native storage. But the Vivo X60 Pro is still a very nice flagship thanks to its Exynos 1050 chipset built at 5 nm, and it offers the same memory configuration. With the OPPO Reno 5 Pro+, you get an older Snapdragon 865 chipset, but it is still flagship-class.

Camera

Just do not choose the Xiaomi Mi 11 if you need the most advanced camera phone. Due to the lack of a telephoto sensor and a periscope sensor, it does not support optical zoom. You can get the optical zoom with the Oppo Reno5 Pro+ and Vivo X60 Pro. The latter has the best zoom capabilities and Carl Zeiss lenses, but the former has a better main camera, at least on the paper: a 50 MP Sony IMX766 sensor. Overall, the Vivo X60 Pro looks slightly more advanced as a camera phone, thanks to great secondary sensors.

Battery

Xiaomi Mi 11 has the biggest battery, but it does not necessarily mean it has a longer battery life in every scenario. Given its higher display resolution, it has a shorter battery life in some situations. The Oppo Reno5 Pro+ has a good 4500 mAh battery, but you should note that the 7 nm Snapdragon 865 chipset is less efficient. Xiaomi Mi 11 is the only one to feature wireless charging, but the Oppo Reno5 Pro+ has the fastest charging tech with a 65W power.

Price

The prices of Xiaomi Mi 11 start from €504/$611 just like the Oppo Reno5 Pro+, while Vivo X60 Pro starts from €565/$685. There is not a definitive winner of this comparison: the Oppo Reno5 Pro+ has the best design and great cameras, Vivo X60 Pro is the greatest camera phone and it boasts a 5 nm chipset, Xiaomi Mi 11 has the best display and hardware but it is inferior as a camera phone. Which one would you go for?
