Highlights Realme GT 5G Master Edition specs tipped ahead of launch.

Key specs include the Snapdragon 870 SoC, 90Hz display, 108MP triple cameras, and 65W fast charging.

Realme GT 5G Master Edition could be the Realme GT camera flagship the brand plans to launch in July.

Realme GT 5G Master Edition specifications have been tipped in a new leak. The phone is known to be in the works ever since Realme VP Xu Qi Chase posted an image on Weibo last week. Rumour has it that the Realme RMX3366 phone that appeared on TENAA is not the Realme X9 but the Realme GT 5G Master Editon. Now, the well-known tipster Ice Universe has allegedly revealed the Realme GT 5G Master Edition specifications (via Gizmochina). The leak reveals the chipset, display, cameras, and fast charging support, among other things.

Realme GT 5G Master Edition specs tipped

The Realme GT 5G Master Edition is powered by the Snapdragon 870 chipset, which means the phone falls below the Realme GT 5G that comes with the Snapdragon 888 SoC. While the upcoming phone may come with a sub-flagship chipset, the cameras will reportedly see an upgrade. While the Realme GT 5G offers a 64MP triple camera system, the Realme GT 5G Master Edition will feature a 108MP triple camera setup.

The 108MP camera sensor suggests this could be the Realme GT camera flagship that the company plans to launch in July. Additionally, the phone is tipped to feature a 6.5-inch display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The Realme GT phone will pack a 4,500mAh battery and support 65W fast charging. This is all we know about the Realme GT 5G Master Edition from the leak.

It would be wise to take this leak with a pinch of salt as there seems to be some discrepancy between the leak provided by Ice Universe and the Realme RMX3366 phone that appeared on TENAA. Then again, these could be two completely different devices. The Realme RMX3366 could indeed be the Realme X9 while the one leaked this week could be the Realme GT camera flagship. Both devices are expected to launch in July, so we will just have to wait and see which one comes first.
