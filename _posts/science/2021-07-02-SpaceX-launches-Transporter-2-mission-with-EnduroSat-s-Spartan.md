SpaceX has launched the Transporter 2 mission from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. EnduroSat`s software-defined 6U NanoSat gets to orbit on the same mission.

This is the first of nine upcoming Shared Missions of EnduroSat, that will streamline the deployment of commercial sensors, and verify next-gen technologies in Space. Spartan, is carrying seven payloads. It is demonstrating the capability of the software-defined architecture to provide customers easy access to space data.

This was the second dedicated rideshare flight organised by SpaceX and carried 88 spacecraft to an approximately 525 km altitude sun-synchronous orbit (SSO).

Raycho Raychev, Founder & CEO of EnduroSat, said: “We are thrilled to see the innovations and the incredible work, that our partners and customers will do in orbit, thanks to Spartan. We believe that EnduroSat’s Shared Satellite Service is a paradigm shift that eliminates the entire complexity of getting sensors to orbit. Give us what you want to fly and in a few months’ time you are operating your sensor in space and downlinking data to the ground.”
