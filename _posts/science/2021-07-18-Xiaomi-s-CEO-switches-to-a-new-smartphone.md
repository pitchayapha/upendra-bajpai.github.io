Over the past few months, there have been several reports regarding Xiaomi’s upcoming flagships. We have seen reports on the upcoming Xiaomi Mi MIX 4 and Xiaomi Mi 12 series. According to Canalys statistics, Xiaomi is now the second-largest smartphone brand globally surpassing Apple. Also, Lei Jun is at the top of Forbes China’s 2021 Best CEO list. Celebrating these feats, Lei Jun took to Weibo and posted some messages. However, we also noticed that Lei Jun is not using his regular device for posting. Before today, Lei Jun’s Weibo posts come from his Xiaomi Mi 11 Pro. However, his posts today are from an unidentified smartphone.

From the image above, we can see that as of July 14th, Lei Jun’s post comes from the Xiaomi Mi 11 Pro. However, as of July 16th, his messages come from a “Xiaomi Phone”. According to the speculations so far, Lei Jun is now using either the Xiaomi Mi MIX 4 or Xiaomi Mi 12. However, since the MIX 4 will arrive before the Mi 12, if Lei Jun is using any of its upcoming flagships, it should be the Xiaomi Mi MIX 4.

Xiaomi Mi MIX 4 speculations so far

It is already public knowledge that the Xiaomi Mi MIX 4 will come with an under-screen camera. This technology will enable this smartphone to completely hide the front camera under the screen. This is also Xiaomi’s first under-screen proactive mass-produced model. At the same time, this smartphone also comes with standard components of today’s flagship phones. With the under-display camera, the bezel is ultra-thin giving this device a true full-screen appearance.

According to reports, the display panel of the Xiaomi Mi MIX 4 will come from Huaxing Optoelectronics. Xiaomi promises that the under-screen camera will have a good image effect. There are also reports that the display resolution of the Xiaomi Mi MIX 4 is FHD+. Not only that, the Xiaomi Mi MIX 4 will also come with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 Plus flagship processor. In terms of configuration, this phone will use a 5000 mAh large battery but some leaks say that it will come with a 4500 mAh battery. Whatever the case is, it will support 120W fast charging (wire) and the wireless fast charging capacity will be very high (70W or more). According to a recent leak, the price of the Xiaomi Mi MIX 4 will start at 5999 yuan ($928). This makes it more expensive than the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra which is currently the most expensive Xiaomi smartphone.
