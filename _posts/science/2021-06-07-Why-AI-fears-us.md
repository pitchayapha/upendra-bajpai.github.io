“There seems to be something missing about reciprocity,” said Ophelia Delois, a philosopher at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich. “Basically, we treat complete strangers better than AI.”

In recent research, Dr. Deroy and her neuroscientist colleagues tried to understand why. Researchers have paired human subjects with invisible partners, sometimes humans, and sometimes AI. Each pair then played a series of classic economic games called Trust, Prisoner’s Dilemma, Chicken and Stag Hunt, and Reciprocity created to evaluate and reward cooperation.

The lack of reciprocity towards AI is generally thought to reflect a lack of trust. Why do we have to do it when it’s super-rational and numb, and after all, it’s certainly an end in itself and unlikely to cooperate? Dr. Deroy and her colleagues , Unlike this, I’ve probably come to a less comforting conclusion. Their research found that people are unlikely to work with bots, even if they want to work with them. We don’t trust bots, we trust them. We guarantee that bots are benevolent and that they are S suckers of capital. Abuse.

That conclusion was supported by subsequent conversations with study participants. “Not only did they tend to go against the collaborative intent of artificial agents, but they did not report guilt if they basically betrayed the bot’s trust, but in the case of humans they did.” Dr. Deroy said. “I just ignore the bots and I don’t feel like I’ve broken each other’s obligations,” she added.

This can affect the real world. When we think of AI, we tend to think of Alexa and Siris in the future world. It can form some sort of fake intimate relationship with them. However, most of our interactions are one-off, often wordless encounters. Imagine driving on the freeway and wanting cars to join you in front of you. If you find yourself driving unmanned, you are much less likely to get in. Also, if the AI ​​doesn’t explain your bad behavior, it can lead to an accident.
