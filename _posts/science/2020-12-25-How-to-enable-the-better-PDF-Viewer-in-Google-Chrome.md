Google Chrome may be used to display PDF documents; the feature is included natively in the web browser, which means that it does not require third-party tools or extensions to function.

PDF viewing functionality is basic and while that is fine for going through a PDF document, it lacks when it comes to everything else.

Google has been working on an update for the integrated PDF Viewer, and it has been overdo, considering that web browsers such as Firefox provide a much better experience when it comes to viewing PDFs in the browser.

Right now, Chrome users may use the viewer to zoom in and out, print the document, and change its orientation. Compared to Firefox, which has a table of contents, automatic zooming, or quick jump functionality, it is lacking.

The Chrome PDF viewer update will change that. It is currently available behind a flag in all recent versions of the web browser, including Chrome Stable. The update introduces a table of content, two-page view option, quick jump support, and more.

Enable Chrome's new PDF Viewer

Load chrome://flags/ in the browser's address bar. Alternatively, load chrome://flags/#pdf-viewer-update directly and skip the second step. Search for PDF Viewer. Set the PDF Viewer Update flag to Enabled. The PDF Viewer Update description: When enabled, the PDF viewer will display an updated UI with new options and features.

It is available for all desktop versions of Google Chrome. Restart Google Chrome.

The new PDF viewer is active immediately in the Chrome web browser. You will notice the difference right away thanks to the new table of contents sidebar that it displays when it is activated.

A click on the menu icon on the right side of the toolbar displays the new "two page view" option that you may activate to display two sheets side by side.

Chrome Canary users may enable PDF Viewer Presentation Mode furthermore to unlock a full screen PDF viewing mode. Just use the shortcut F11 in the PDF viewer in Google Chrome to toggle the feature.

Full mode hides the browser UI when it is activated.

Now You: do you use the PDF viewer of your browser, or a third-party program? (via Techdows)
