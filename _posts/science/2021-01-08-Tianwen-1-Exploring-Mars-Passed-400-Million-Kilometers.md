The National Space Agency of China announced that the country's Mars research satellite Tianwen-1 has traveled more than 3 million kilometers as of Sunday, January 400, and will enter Mars orbit next month. It has been reported that the research satellite, traveling in the direction of Mars, has been flying in space for 163 days as of yesterday, more than 130 million kilometers from the earth and 8,3 million kilometers from Mars.

The National Space Agency of China stated that the satellite is functioning very well, and in more than a month it will decelerate and prepare to land before entering Mars' orbit. Since the Mars probe satellite was launched into space on July 23, 2020, it has captured images of the earth and the Moon each and took several selfies. Meanwhile, he carried out three course corrections, a maneuver in deep space, and self-checks of the large number of loads he was carrying.

Tianwen-1, which weighs about five tons, consists of an orbiting satellite, a surface landing vehicle and a surface mobile vehicle. The spacecraft sent has been designed for orbit, landing, and the use of a surface probe.

After Tianwen-1 orbits Mars, it will search for potential landing sites for two to three months. For this, it will use a high resolution camera and land on the favorable location it has determined in May. After landing, the rover will be mobilized for pre-planned scientific discoveries for at least 90 Mars days. The orbiting satellite, on the other hand, is foreseen for a Mars year (approximately 687 Earth days) of service and will function as a communication station with a rover vehicle while conducting its own research.
