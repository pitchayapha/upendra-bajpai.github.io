Huawei's HarmonyOS was unveiled last year during the Huawei Developer Conference and there's a report claiming that this year's conference on September 10 will bring the HarmonyOS 2.0. Interestingly, the rumor cites Richard Yu himself, the company's CEO. And the first phone with the in-house operating system will launch as early as next year.

A smartphone running the said OS already exists and will likely hit the market next year along with a number of new devices including PCs, tablets, smart wearables and other IoT products. In fact, the first smartwatch running HarmonyOS is expected to make a debut until the end of this year.
