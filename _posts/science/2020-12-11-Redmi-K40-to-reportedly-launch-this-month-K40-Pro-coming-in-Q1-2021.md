Xiaomi has reportedly been working on launching its flagship smartphone dubbed Mi 11, powered by the newly launched Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 SoC, later this month in China. At the same time, it’s sub-brand Redmi is also working on its flagship smartphone.

Now, a new report coming from China indicates that the launch of Redmi K40, the brand’s upcoming flagship smartphone, should happen quite soon. In fact, it is expected to go official by the end of this month, just like the Mi 11.

It has been confirmed that the upgraded variant of the same, dubbed Redmi K40 Pro, will be launched in the first quarter of 2021. The Pro variant is expected to be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 SoC, given that Lu Weibing had said that the company will be among the firsts to launch an SD888-powered smartphone.

On the other hand, the Redmi K40 is rumored to come powered by the unannounced Qualcomm Snapdragon 700-series chipset. In that case, even though the phone will be announced this month, it will go on sale in 2021.

It seems that the company is following the launch schedule similar to the Redmi K30 and K30 Pro of last year. Redmi had launched its K30 smartphone in December 2019 and then launched the K30 Pro powered by SD865 SoC in early 2020.

As per the recent reports, the Redmi K40 lineup is expected to ditch the pop-up front-facing camera mechanism and will instead come with a punch-hole cutout on top of the display that is expected to have an OLED screen and 120Hz refresh rate support.
