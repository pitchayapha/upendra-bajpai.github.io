These endings result in the following epilogue possibilities:

Epilogue: Where Is My Mind

Epilogue: All Along the Watchtower

Epilogue: New Dawn Fades

Epilogue: Path of Glory (Secret Ending)

No Epilogue

Do Life Paths Have Special Endings?

No. Your Life Path may change your experiences along the way but not the overall ending.

Cyberpunk 2077 has multiple drastically different endings, all of which diverge from a single point and have different unlock requirements before that point in order to access them.

Here are all the endings we’ve found, including what you need to do to reach them and the major choices that occur during them.

How To Beat Cyberpunk 2077

First things first, every ending begins at the same “Point of No Return” mission called Nocturne Op55N1.

This has the player meet Hanako Arasaka at a restaurant called Embers, and you will be warned before starting this mission that there’s no coming back from it, so we’d recommend saving right beforehand.

Additionally, beating the game will create a special save file at this moment that you can then reload, which will also add a few simple bonus items to your inventory, allowing you to pick-up right before it and complete more side content.

Choice: Call Your Romantic Partner or Not

After Misty leaves you to decide, Johnny suggests that you call anyone that wish to say goodbye to. Here, you'll be given the opportunity to call your romantic partner - if you have one! See our Romance Guide for even more information.

Depending on your decision, it will have a minor consequence in your Epilogue. While not super impactful on the main ending, the choice will simply be a fun option to playout should you have built a relationship with a particular character.

Calling Your Love Interest: Calling your love interest will allow you to say your final goodbye, as your not certain if you'll see them again. Saying goodbye will also cause the character in question to make an appearance during the Epilogue - this may depend on your ending though!

Goodbyes Aren't My Style: Should you choose not to call your love interest or simply don't have one, you'll be on your own during the epilogue.

Choice: Who to Team Up With to Raid Arasaka Tower

From here, you go to the roof of Misty’s Esoterica and can choose from five possible routes, all of which are dependent on the side jobs that you have completed.

Here are each of the endings, how to unlock them, and how they can differ. If you're looking for something specific, click the links below to jump to...

Ending 1: Hanako's Path (Trust Arasaka)

Choosing Hanako's Path is the first option that is available without doing any side content at all.

To unlock this ending, simply follow the path of Nocturne Op55N1 to meet Hanako at Embers, and then choose to trust her when speaking to her inside the restaurant.

If you would like to play out this ending you will need to select the following options when prompted.

"Think trusting Arasaka's risky but worth it." "[Take omega-blockers] Yeah. Don't be mad.



After a series of final missions, you will eventually reach an epilogue called "Where Is My Mind" where you are given one last significant choice.

Johnny Silverhand's questline begins with the mission Chippin’ In, which is given to you after speaking to Johnny during a Main Job called Tapeworm.
