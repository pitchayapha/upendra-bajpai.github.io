Google on Tuesday said it would start adding labels to its apps on App Store as per Apple’s new privacy label requirements. The labels may start appearing as soon as this week or by next week.

Apple’s new policy makes it mandatory for developers to reveal how data is getting collected from its App Store users and used to track them. Apple had introduced the policy in early December. The policy also covered new apps and app updates to the App Store (with effect from December 8, 2020).

“The App Store will soon help users understand an app’s privacy practices before they download the app on any Apple platform. On each app’s product page, users can learn about some of the data types the app may collect, and whether that data is linked to them or used to track them. If you haven’t already, enter your app’s privacy information in App Store Connect,” Apple said on its website.

Earlier some reports said Google was trying to skirt the rules by not releasing updates to its apps since Apple’s new police came into the effect. A TechCrunch report, however, rebuffs the notion stating Google did roll out updates to two of its apps, though they did not come with the mandatory privacy label. It further pointed out the app changes are slow during the Holidays and New Year period with Apple’s own App Store closing between December 23-27.

It further said that Google was not the only major app publisher on the App Store that has not implemented the privacy labels yet. The likes of Amazon and Pinterest are too yet to make the changes.
