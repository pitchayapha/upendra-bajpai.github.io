Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is gearing up for another free access period for both Multiplayer and Zombies.

One of the best ways to sell a game is to let people try it out first. Whether there is a beta for players to enjoy or simply a free trial, they love getting their hands on the game for a short time to help decide if they will buy it.

Black Ops Cold War has done this multiple times. Gamers have been given free access for weekends and entire weeks at times. Once more, the most recent Call of Duty is providing that opportunity.
