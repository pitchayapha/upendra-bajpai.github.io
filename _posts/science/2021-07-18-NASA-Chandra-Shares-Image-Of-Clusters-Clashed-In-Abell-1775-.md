The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) recently shared an image of clusters clashed in Abell 1775, a system where a smaller #galaxy cluster has plowed into a larger one. The image has been shared by NASA Hubble’s official Instagram account and has gathered over 21,000 likes and 80 comments.

The caption for the image states, “When the titans of #space — galaxy clusters — collide, extraordinary things can happen. A #new study using NASA's Chandra examines the repercussions after clusters clashed in Abell 1775, a system where a smaller #galaxy cluster has plowed into a larger one”. Check out this beautiful image:

According to Chandra X-ray Observatory, Abell 1775 is a system where a smaller galaxy cluster has plowed into a larger one. Using X-rays from Chandra and data from other telescopes astronomers are piecing together details of this collision. Features in the data, including a curving tail of hot gas and a "cold front", are clues.

It further explains that this is a new image of Abell 1775 which contains X-rays from Chandra (blue), optical data from the Pan-STARRS telescope in Hawaii (blue, yellow, and white), and radio data from the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) in the Netherlands (red).

“The tail is labelled in this image along with a region of gas with a curved edge, called a "cold front," that is denser and cooler than the gas it is plowing into. The tail and the cold front all curve in the same direction, creating a spiral appearance. A separate labelled image shows the field of view of the Chandra data”, states NASA Chandra. Scientists will likely need more observations and modelling to get the full picture of Abell 1775.
