Apple iPhone 13 is available with amazing deals that bring down the effective price to as low as Rs 55,900. But, we have to admit that the discounts are not upfront and include exchange value and exchange bonus being offered by Apple Reseller alongside cashback benefits being offered by new banking partners. So, read on to understand the details.

The iPhone 13 was launched last year at Rs 79,900 for the basic 128GB storage model. Apple's Reseller India iStore is offering a flat Rs 6,000 cashback on the usage of ICICI Bank Debit and Credit cards, Kotak Bank Debit and Credit cards and SBI Credit Cards. This brings down the price to Rs 73,990.

Next, the Reseller is also offering an attractive exchange option where customers can avail up to a Rs 15,000 discount on exchanging an old working smartphone. The Reseller has given an example of the iPhone XR 64GB in a good working condition which can offer consumers a flat Rs 15,000 discount. To top it off, consumers will also get a Rs 3,000 exchange bonus from Reseller, bringing down the effective price of the iPhone 13 down to Rs 55,900.

It's worth noting that the exchange value of the smartphone will depend on the device being exchanged. If you have an old iPhone, for example, the iPhone 11 64GB, then it would offer you a better exchange benefit.

It's worth noting that the same offer is also applicable on the purchase of the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max. With the current offer at the Apple Reseller, consumers can get their hands on the iPhone 13 Pro Max 128GB at as low as Rs 106,900 and iPhone 13 Pro at as low as Rs 96,900.

Refreshing the specs, the iPhone 13 comes with a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display and sports a water-resistant body. The phone sports Apple's all-new Cinematic mode and features a new diagonal camera design. Powered by an A15 Bionic chipset, the iPhone 13 is claimed to offer more battery backup than the iPhone 12.
