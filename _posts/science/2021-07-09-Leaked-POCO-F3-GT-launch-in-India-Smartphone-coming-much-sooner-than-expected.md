POCO F3 GT launch in India is imminent, but there was no word from the company itself which had earlier said that it may happen in the third quarter of 2021. However, it was mum thereafter. It left the door wide open for leaksters to have a field day. And now, a tipster has actually gone ahead and leaked the launch date.

POCO F3 GT launch timeline leak

It has been reported by 91Mobiles that the company will hold the POCO F3 GT launch event in early August - within the first 10 days of the month. However, the full extent of the leak falls woefully short of revealing the actual date. Since there is no actual comment from the company, taking the leak at face value would not be the ideal thing to do.

POCO F3 GT: Real or Rebranded?

For those who are interested in the POCO F3 GT, it has been reported that the smartphone is actually the Redmi K40 Game Enhanced Edition and the only difference is that it has been rebranded. This was according to leakster Kacper Skrzypek. Poco is known to launch Redmi phones under its brand so, itâ€™s quite possible for this to happen in this case too.

Alternatively, the phone was also speculated to be an upgraded version of the Poco F3 that was launched in March.

POCO F3 GT: Specifications and features

Earlier, while announcing the phone, the company had shared a teaser video confirming the Poco F3 GT will be powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 1200 processor. Redmi K40 Gaming Edition also uses the Dimensity 1200 processor. It is likey that the phone will have 5G support.

For the other POCO F3 GT specifications, we can expect a 6.67-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 480Hz touch sampling rate. The smartphone could launch with up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. It could also pack a 5,000mAh battery with 67W fast charging support.
