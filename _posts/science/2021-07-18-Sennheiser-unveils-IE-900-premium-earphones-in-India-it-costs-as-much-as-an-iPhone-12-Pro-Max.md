Sennheiser IE 900 earphones: Specifications

Considering the price of IE 900, it is definitely not for the casual listeners, it has been strictly designed for the purists. The company says that Sennheiser has introduced its new X3R system in the IE 900 that delivers coherent, artefact-free “Sennheiser Sound” that is found in large headphones. The company has bundled silicone ear adapters and three elastic foam ear adapter sets in three different sizes.

“Our goal was to achieve a transparent sound with no distracting peaks or troughs. One thing this requires is a clear separation of lows and mids. To ensure accuracy across this critical frequency band, we’ve employed what is known as an acoustic back volume. It’s a small chamber within a chamber we have tuned to manage the slope and amplitude of the base lift,” Sennheiser said in a statement.

The earphones are equipped with a 7 mm True Response transducer. The earphones come with a single driver system. As per the company, the singer driver infused in the earphones can remove obstacles that are introduced by multi-driver arrays.
