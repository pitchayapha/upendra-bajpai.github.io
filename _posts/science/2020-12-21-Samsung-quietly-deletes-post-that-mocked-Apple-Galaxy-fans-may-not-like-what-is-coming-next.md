There have been rumours in the smartphone industry that Samsung will soon follow Apple's lead and will remove the charger from its Galaxy S21 retail box. While there is no confirmation on this, one of the biggest proof is said to be Samsung deleting its post, in which it recently mocked Apple by showing that it's smartphones come with a Galaxy charger, unlike iPhones.

The post by Samsung came earlier this year when Apple launched its iPhone 12, 12 Mini, 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max. It also announced that moving forward, none of its iPhones will come with a charger inside the box. This is said to be Apple's way of reducing the carbon emission and ultimately being a carbon-free company in the next few years.

Samsung in its post (which now has been deleted), announced that “Our Galaxy phone can provide you with everything you need from the basic charger to the best camera, battery performance and memory.” However, Samsung deleting this Facebook post seems to be a strong evidence that the South Korean tech phone might just follow the suit and simply launch the Galaxy S21 smartphones with earphones only.

Fortunately, we don't have to wait for long to see what happens next as the company is set to launch the S21 series in January next year.

According to a recent revelation by Samsung India's largest store in Bengaluru, these smartphones will be launching in India in January itself.

Samsung's mobile chief also recently indicated that more smartphones will be supporting the S Pen in 2021, including the foldable phones. It may lead you to think that there won’t be a Galaxy Note lineup in future. However, according to a separate report quoting Samsung’s unnamed official it was mentioned that the Galaxy Note series for 2021 is under works.
