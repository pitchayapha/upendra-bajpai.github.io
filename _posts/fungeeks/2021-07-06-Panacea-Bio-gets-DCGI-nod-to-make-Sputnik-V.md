The initial test batches produced at Panacea Biotec’s facilities at Baddi in Himachal Pradesh were earlier shipped to the Gamaleya Center in Russia for quality control.

“The said batches have successfully passed all the checks for quality parameters both at the Gamaleya Center in Russia and at the Central Drug Laboratory, Kasauli, Himachal Pradesh in India,” the company statement read.

Dr Reddy’s Laboratories that has tied up with RDIF to market the first 250 million doses of the Russian vaccine, is also likely to market the doses produced by Panacea. Sputnik V was registered in India under the emergency use authorisation procedure on April 12 and vaccination against Covid-19 with the Russian vaccine started on May 14.

As part of the soft launch, the vaccine has been administered in several Indian cities so far, including Visakhapatnam, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi, Baddi, Chennai, Miryalaguda, and Kolhapur. Sputnik V has been registered in 67 countries globally with total population of over 3.5 billion people.
