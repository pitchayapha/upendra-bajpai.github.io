Maruti Suzuki is currently the leading manufacturer in terms of selling CNG vehicles. They have the most number of CNG vehicles in their line-up. They have the Eeco, S-Presso, Celeri0, WagonR and Ertiga. For commercial vehicles they Tour S and Super Carry. Now, it seems that Maruti Suzuki will be expanding their CNG line-up by introducing a CNG version of Dzire. A new test mule of Dzire with an emission testing kit was recently spied. The launch of the Dzire CNG is expected to happen around January 2022.

From the pictures, we can see that the rear suspension is bogged down, which means there is quite a bit of weight on the rear tyres. This can be because the CNG tank is fitted in the boot. This will decrease the boot space by few litres. A stock Dzire has a boot capacity of 378-litres. No other changes can be seen from the pictures.

It is not known which engine will be used by Maruti Suzuki for the CNG version of the Dzire. The new Dzire comes with a 1.2-litre DualJet petrol engine. It is a naturally aspirated engine that produces 90 PS of max power and 113 Nm of peak torque. We have not yet seen this engine is paired to a CNG system. So, it would be interesting to see how well does the engine behave when it is running on CNG. So, there is a very high chance that Maruti Suzuki will be using the previous 1.2-litre naturally aspirated engine that used to produce 83 PS of max power and 113 Nm of peak torque.

S-CNG

Maruti Suzuki says that they re-tune the chassis and suspension set up to handle the additional weight. They also work on the braking system because the additional weight can mess up the braking of the vehicle. The manufacturer also crash tests and evaluate the vehicle after the CNG System has been installed.

The wiring inside the vehicle is integrated with the system wiring so that there are no chances of a short circuit. The pipes and joints that Maruti Suzuki is using are of stainless steel so that they do not leak or corrode. There is also a switch that has been installed to ensure that the vehicle does not start during the CNG filling process.

The S-CNG vehicles come with Auto-Switch which helps in easily and instantly switching between both fuel options. The manufacturer also continues to offer a warranty if you get the factory-fitted CNG. There is a dedicated CNG gauge to monitor the CNG level just like you have your fuel gauge.

Diesel coming back

Maruti Suzuki is also working on reviving its 1.5-litre diesel engine which was killed because of the BS6 emission norms. The engine will first debut with the Ertiga in January. Then it is expected to be showcased with the Vitara Brezza and it will find its way to Ciaz.

Other manufacturer’s CNG vehicles

Hyundai also offers some of their vehicles with a factory-fitted CNG. There is Aura which is a direct competitor to the Dzire. Then there is the Santro, which is a budget hatchback and Hyundai also offers the Grand i10 Nios with CNG. For commercial buyers, they have kept the Xcent Prime.

Tata is also working on CNG versions of the Tiago and the Tigor. Both the vehicles have been spied when they were waiting in a queue at a CNG station.
