New Delhi: Tata Sons' power generation unit, Tata Power , has refuted media reports claiming a tie-up with the US electric vehicle giant Tesla for setting up charging infrastructure in India."Our EV charging business is constantly examining and exploring various growth opportunities. No arrangement or agreements have been finalised as reported in the media," the company said in a stock exchange filing.It further added, "We confirm that the news item published in the media dated March 12, 2021 is factually incorrect."According to a CNBC-TV 18 report on Friday, the talks between Tata Power and Tesla are in the initial stages and no arrangements have been finalised yet.Shares of Tata Power had risen 5.5% to their best closing level since June 9, 2014, after the report.Earlier last week, Tata Motors Ltd denied any tie-up with Tesla, after media reports suggested the two companies were discussing a partnership.ETAuto was the first to break the story that electric-car maker Tesla will foray into the Indian market with plans to import and sell its Model 3 electric sedan in India.
