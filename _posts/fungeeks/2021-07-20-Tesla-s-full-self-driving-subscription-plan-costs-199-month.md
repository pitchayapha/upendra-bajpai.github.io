The FSD capability will offer Tesla owners access to a host of advanced driver assistance features.

Tesla has introduced the Full Self-Driving (FSD) subscription package for US$ 199 per month for customers with the basic autopilot package. However, those using the enhanced autopilot package will have to churn out US$ 99 / month to upgrade to FSD.

The subscription package for Tesla's FSD technology allows customers the flexibility to use and cancel the feature whenever required. Previously, Tesla offered the full self-driving technology with a one-time payment of US$ 10,000.

According to Tesla, only those vehicles with Full Self-Driving computer 3.0 or above, along with either the basic or enhanced autopilot feature are eligible to subscribe for FSD capability. Customers can, however, install the FSD computer hardware separately, before purchasing the subscription plan.

The full self-driving capability will offer Tesla owners access to a host of advanced driver assistance features. These features are said to be designed to provide more guidance and assisted driving, compared to the standard autopilot system. However, like the autopilot feature, FSD too will require active supervision by the driver.
