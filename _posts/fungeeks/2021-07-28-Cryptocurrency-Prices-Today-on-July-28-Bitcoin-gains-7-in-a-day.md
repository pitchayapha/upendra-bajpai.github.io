Cryptocurrency prices are in the green on July 28. The global cryptocurrency market cap is $1.54 trillion, a 6.42 percent increase over the last day, while the total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $95.67 billion, which makes a 17.17 percent decrease.

The volume of all stable coins is now $77.58 billion â€“ 81.09 percent of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. Bitcoin's price is currently $36,982.76 and its dominance is currently 48.35 percent, an increase of 0.54 percent over the day.

This comes after the Middle East's first bitcoin fund launched on the Dubai bourse on Wednesday, with Canadian digital asset manager 3iQ Corp seeking to raise around $200 million in the offering.

Created in 2008 as an alternative to traditional currencies, bitcoin is the world's most popular virtual unit, but its price has slumped recently due to fresh moves from China to crack down on cryptocurrencies.

"3iQ Corp., Canada's largest digital asset investment fund manager... today officially listed The Bitcoin Fund on Nasdaq Dubai, the region's international exchange," the bourse said in a statement.
