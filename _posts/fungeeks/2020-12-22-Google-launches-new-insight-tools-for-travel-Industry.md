Google on Monday launched a new website for helping the travel industry in India. Called ‘Travel Insights with Google’, the website gives insights on tourism demand trends, booking trends, and so on. The company says industry participants can use the website to better analyse the travel demand and leverage insights to prepare their businesses.

Google’s Travel Insights offers insights based on user search data. It provides two kinds of time-specific trends such as Destination Insights, which gives an idea about the top sources of demand for a destination, and destinations within countries that travellers are most interested in travelling. Hotel Insights gives information on the properties of different sizes with a focus on small and independent hotels.

Google reveals that it recorded a growth in search interest for domestic travels to cities such as Chandigarh, Shirdi, and Bagdogra in the month of November. Travellers in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and Gujarat top the searches for accommodation options, it said.

“During the same period, the tool shows that the top demand for outbound travel from India by air came for Male, Bangkok and Dubai, while the top growing cities by search interest were Male, Genoa and Boston,” it added.

“In addition, the website also hosts the Travel Analytics Center. Available to Google’s commercial partners in the travel sector, this will enable these organizations to combine their own Google account data with broader Google demand data and insights to give a clearer picture of how to manage their operations and find opportunities to reach potential visitors,” it further said.

Google said that the website would also be a one-stop destination for other Google resources, including skills training courses through Grow with Google, Digital Garage and Google for Small Business, and our tourism Acceleration Programme with the UN World Tourism Organisation.
