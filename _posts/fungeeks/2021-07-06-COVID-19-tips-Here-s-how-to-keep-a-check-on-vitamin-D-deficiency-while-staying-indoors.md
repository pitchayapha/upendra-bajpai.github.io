How to get enough Vitamin D when staying indoors for maximum time

There are various food items rich in vitamin D like -- cod liver oil, coriander, orange, yoghurt, cheese, garlic, dark chocolate, black mustard seeds, mushrooms, turmeric, and Kashmiri garlic -- which can help one boost their immunity naturally.

One can also take Vitamin D supplements available at medical stores, however, it is advisable to consult a physician before consuming medical supplements.

Consumption of Vitamin D rich foods

Have two cloves of garlic or 4-5 cloves of Kashmiri garlic early in the morning on an empty stomach, and after dinner.

A tiny bit of dark chocolate once a day is also a good source of Vitamin D.

Having mushrooms once a week will help balance vitamin D levels in one's body. One should try and include bajra or ragi roti in meals as well, to quicken the process of upping the vitamin level.

Consumption of black mustard seeds and half a tablespoon of turmeric powder are helpful to boost vitamin D levels.
