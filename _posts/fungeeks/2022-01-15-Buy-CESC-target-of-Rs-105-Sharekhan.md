Sharekhan's research report on CESC

Q3FY22 consolidated PAT remained flat y-o-y at Rs. 329 crore as benefit of higher short-term power rates at Dhariwal (PAT up 79% y-o-y) and steady standalone performance was offset by a sharp 90% y-o-y decline in profit from Rajasthan DF. Standalone power generation grew by 2.7% y-o-y to 1,242 million units but power sales volumes was muted with growth of 0.7% y-o-y to 2,173 million units as demand from schools was still below pre-COVID levels. Improvement in financial performance of Rajasthan/Malegaon DFs in FY23 would boost consolidated earnings. Potential higher profit/RoI (target of Rs. 100 crore PAT and RoI of 12% over next 4 years) at Chandigarh discoms to create value.



Outlook

We maintain a Buy rating on CESC with an unchanged SoTP-based PT of Rs. 105 as valuation seems attractive at 1.1x its FY2023E P/BV and stock offers a healthy dividend yield of 5-6%.
