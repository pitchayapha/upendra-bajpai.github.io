On the other hand, amid rumours on India not granting permission, Krafton is taking various pro-India steps to make sure that PUBG Mobile comes back to India.

The India government last week declared that ‘“MEITY has not given any permission for launch of PUBG”. The RTI query was filed on November 30, reported Insidesport.

However, PUBG has a huge fan base in India. And the PUBG Mobile Global version 1.2 beta APK link is available for download for Android users in India.

As per updates from PUBG Corporation, it was preparing to launch the game to cater to the needs of the Indian market. In this context, PUBG Mobile India also released the first official teasers for the game on November 14, featuring three PUBG Mobile influencers — Dynamo, Kronten, and Jonathan. However, PUBG Mobile hasn’t announced any official release date for the Indian version of the game.
