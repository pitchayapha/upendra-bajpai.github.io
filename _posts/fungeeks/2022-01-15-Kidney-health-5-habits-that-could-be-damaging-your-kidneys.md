Key Highlights Kidneys as the bean-shaped organs that are part of the urinary tract Kidneys are an important organ as they help the body get rid of toxic waste These organs play a crucial role in the excretory system

New Delhi: Ever since we were kids, we have been introduced to kidneys as the bean-shaped organs that are part of the urinary tract. But there is more to these fist-sized organs. These organs work tirelessly towards filtering out excess water and waste from blood to produce the fluid commonly known as urine. Kidneys are an important organ as they help the body get rid of toxic waste and play a crucial role in the excretory system.

Kidney damaging habits

Here are some habits that might be damaging your kidneys:

You are missing out on hydration: About 60 per cent of the human body is made up of water. This makes it essential to keep the body well hydrated to ensure its efficient functioning. The human kidney too, can go through substantial damage in case of dehydration. You can't say 'Na' to sodium: Salt is a commonly used ingredient that can enhance the flavour of any dish significantly. While it's true that maintaining healthy levels of sodium in the body is important, excessive sodium intake can lead to hypertension which can put the kidneys at risk of failure. To maintain a healthy consumption of salt, one must be mindful of their diet and avoid processed foods, fried items, and fast foods. You're drinking your health away: Health complications such as liver damage, cardiovascular issues, etc. due to alcohol consumption is well known. However, did you know that going overboard with alcohol consumption can also damage the kidneys? The adverse impact of hypertension due to alcohol intake can increase the risk of kidney failure and therefore must be avoided. You've been popping a lot of painkillers: The use of painkillers has become excessively common in recent times. While it's true that sometimes their use may be inevitable, however, experts recommend avoiding it when possible. This is because the use of painkillers, especially nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, can put the kidneys at risk of damage. You smoke: If you're someone who is a regular smoker, quit. If you're someone who is an occasional smoker, quit. No matter what kind of smoker you categorise yourself as, quit. The adverse effects of smoking are well known but it 6does not stop people from getting that 'one' puff. Among the various health complications that can emerge due to smoking, an increased risk of kidney cancer can also be a potential one.
