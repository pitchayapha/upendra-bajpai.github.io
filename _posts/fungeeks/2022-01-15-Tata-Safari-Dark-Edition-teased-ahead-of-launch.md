Last month we reported that Tata Motors has started working on a Dark Edition of its flagship, Safari. Now, they have officially teased the launch of the Safari Dark Edition on various social media platforms. The manufacturer has released a short teaser of just 16 seconds in which we can see the front of the Safari Dark Edition. The launch will happen next week.

The Dark Edition will be the second special edition of the Safari. Tata Motors already sell Adventure Persona Edition and Gold Edition. Tata has figured out a way to make its special editions successful. Usually, now special paint schemes do not attract so much attention but with Tata Motors the case is different.

Just like other Dark Editions, Safari will only get cosmetic changes. It will be finished in a deep black paint shade, there will be a #Dark emblem on the side fenders. The alloy wheels will also be finished in a darker shade. They could be the same ones that are currently being used on the Harrier Dark Edition as they also measure 18-inches in size.

The front grille, the window belt lines, outside rearview mirrors and the roof rails will be finished in black now. The upholstery will be finished in black leather with blue tri-arrow elements that you will be able to spot throughout the cabin. There will be #DARK embroidery on the headrests and even the roof liner will be finished in black.

Engine stays the same

The Safari Dark Edition will continue to come with a 2.0-litre diesel engine that produces 170 PS of max power and 350 Nm of peak torque. It will continue to come with a 6-speed torque converter automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual gearbox. This engine also does duty on Tata Harrier, MG Hector Twins and Jeep Compass.

Features will stay the same

There will be no new features with the Dark Edition. So, there will be a part digital screen with an analogue speedometer, touchscreen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, automatic climate control, multi-function steering wheel, electric adjustment for driver seat, drive modes, panoramic sunroof, JBL sound system, air purifier, cruise control and much more.

Tata Motors working on petrol engine for Harrier and Safari

The sales of homegrown manufacturers have increased significantly in the past few years because of which they have started developing a new petrol engine for Harrier and Safari. It will essentially be a 1.2-litre petrol engine that we have seen on Nexon but with a fourth cylinder. It will have a displacement of 1.5-litres and will be turbocharged. The power output of the engine is expected to be somewhere around 160 bhp and the peak torque should be around 250 Nm. This engine is also expected to come with a 6-speed manual gearbox or a 6-speed torque converter automatic gearbox.
