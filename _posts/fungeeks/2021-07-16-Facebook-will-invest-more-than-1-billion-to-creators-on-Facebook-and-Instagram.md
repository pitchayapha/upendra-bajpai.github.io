Facebook will invest more than $1 billion to creators on Facebook and Instagram

This afternoon, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in a post that Facebook will create new programs to invest more than $1 billion to incentivize creators to make content for Facebook and Instagram. The company appears to be making efforts to keep creators around and draw users to the platforms.

We want to build the best platforms for millions of creators to make a living, so we're creating new programs to invest over $1 billion to reward creators for great content they create on Facebook and Instagram through 2022. Investing in creators isn't new for us, but I'm excited to expand this work over time. More details soon.

Facebook’s Newsroom added more details about the announcement.

This investment will include new bonus programs that pay eligible creators for hitting certain milestones when they use our creative and monetization tools. We’ll also provide seed funding for creators to produce their content. Our goal is to help as many creators as possible find sustainable, long-term success on our apps.

Bonuses are new and a new place within the Instagram app will arrive sometime this summer where they can see which bonuses they can earn. Currently, bonuses are available to creators who sign up to place ads in their livestreams, and Stars bonuses will begin being offered to a select group of gamers for hitting specific ‘Stars’ milestones.

The first round of bonuses for Instagram users will only be offered by invite. Creators are incentivized to put IGTV Ads in their videos and can also earn bonuses by reaching badge milestones in live videos. A bonus for Reels will launch in the summer where creators can earn bonuses for posting Reels.

Facebook and Instagram have felt impact from TikTok’s exponential growth in the last few years. The company is hoping to win back some of the engagement (and ad revenue) by encouraging users to make original content for the platforms.
