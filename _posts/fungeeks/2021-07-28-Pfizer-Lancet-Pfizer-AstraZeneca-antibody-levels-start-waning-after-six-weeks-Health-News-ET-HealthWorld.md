LONDON: Total antibody levels start to wane six weeks after complete immunization with Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines, and can reduce by more than 50 per cent over 10 weeks, according to study published in The Lancet journal.The researchers from University College London UCL ) in the UK noted that if the antibody levels carry on dropping at this rate, there are concerns that the protective effects of the vaccines may also begin to wear off, particularly against new variants.However, they said, how soon that might happen cannot be predicted yet.The UCL Virus Watch study also found that antibody levels are substantially higher following two doses of the Pfizer vaccine than after two shots of the AstraZeneca preventive, known as Covishield in India.Antibody levels were also much higher in vaccinated people than those with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, they said."The levels of antibody following both doses of either the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccine were initially very high, which is likely to be an important part of why they are so protective against severe Covid-19," said Madhumita Shrotri from UCL Institute of Health Informatics "However, we found these levels dropped substantially over the course of two to three months," Shrotri said in a statement.The findings based on data from over 600 people aged 18 and above were consistent across all groups of people regardless of age, chronic illnesses or sex, according to the researchers.The authors highlight that although the clinical implications of waning antibody levels are not yet clear, some decline was expected and current research shows that vaccines remain effective against severe disease.For Pfizer, antibody levels reduced from a median of 7506 Units per millilitre ( U/mL ) at 21–41 days, to 3320 U/mL at 70 or more days.For AstraZeneca vaccine, antibody levels reduced from a median of 1201 U/mL at 0–20 days to 190 U/mL at 70 or more days, over five-fold reduction.
