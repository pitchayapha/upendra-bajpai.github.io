Chinese state media said on Thursday that the country had confirmed one case of human infection with H5N6 strain of bird flu. The case has been confirmed in China's Sichuan province. As per the Chinese media, a 55-year-old man was hospitalised in Bazhong after he came into the hospital with a fever and tested positive for the strain.

Chinese state-run CCTV said that local officials “activated an emergency response and sterilized the area”

The report said that risk of widespread infections was low. It cited an unnamed expert.

H5N6 virus is one of the few potentially dangerous virus strain that scientists have been finding over the years in flocks of poultry. The strain was first detected in Laos

Till last week, 32 confirmed cases of human infections and 19 deaths have been recorded with the World Health Organisation from 2014.
