Key Highlights Most people associate 'fat' with unhealthy food and body However, a specific type of fat, called the brown fat, present in the bodies of some people have shown to reduce risk of diseases As per the study, people who have more brown fat tend to have a reduced risk of developing conditions such as type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease

New Delhi: All of us have been conditioned to perceive 'fat' as bad. When we say someone or even we ourselves are fat, it means we or they are overweight, or obese. When we say some food contains a lot of fat, it means we should not eat it, as it will cause us to gain weight. However, it turns out, fat is not always bad, and some types of fats are actually good to have.

Unlike white fat, having brown fat is healthy

According to the latest study, people with brown fat are less likely to develop or suffer from serious diseases. Unlike white fat, brown fat may be healthy, and prevent the risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes and heart health issues.

Brown fat is found in newborns and helps to burn calories to create heat in the body. According to the NHS, the brown fat tends to be replaced with bad, white fat, as we grow older, causing more weight gain.

Research has, however, now found that even some adults have ample brown fat. The new study was published in Nature Medicine. It involved 52,000 people with detectable brown fat were less likely to suffer from conditions such as type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease.



Assistant Professor Paul Cohen, of The Rockefeller University Hospital, said: "For the first time, it reveals a link to lower risk of certain conditions.

"These findings make us more confident about the potential of targeting brown fat for therapeutic benefit," reported Yahoo News.

It was only in 2009 that scientists realised that brown fat was found in some adults, the Rockefeller University Hospital researchers said.

Ever since then, researchers have scrambled to study the elusive fat cells, which possess the power to burn calories to produce heat in cold conditions.

But it’s been difficult to find people with brown fat, as it only shows up on PET scans, a special type of medical imaging.

As per lead author Tobias Becher, he realised that existing PET scans for cancer could offer an opportunity to find brown fat.

Becher said: "We realised this could be a valuable resource to get us started with looking at brown fat at a population scale.”

The researchers then reviewed 130,000 PET scans from more than 52,000 patients and found the presence of brown fat in nearly 10 per cent of individuals.

Several common and chronic diseases were found to be less prevalent among people with detectable brown fat.

For example, only 4.6 per cent had type 2 diabetes, compared with 9.5 per cent of people who did not have detectable brown fat.

The study found the newest links between three conditions and brown fat – hypertension, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease. No relation between these diseases and brown fat had been explored in studies previously.

"The natural question that everybody has is, 'What can I do to get more brown fat?'" Cohen said. "We don't have a good answer to that yet, but it will be an exciting space for scientists to explore in the upcoming years."

"We are considering the possibility that brown fat tissue does more than consume glucose and burn calories, and perhaps actually participates in hormonal signalling to other organs,” he added.
