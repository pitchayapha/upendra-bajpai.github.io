It is a black colour sedan and the paint itself has not faded away at any place. It gets all the features like projector headlamps, chrome grille, auto folding ORVMs with turn indicators, alloy wheels, LED tail lamps with S500 badging at the rear. Even though, this is an older generation model, it was filled to the brim with features.

On the inside, Mercedes Benz S500 gets long list of features like hot and cold ventilation function for all seats, electrical adjustments for all four seats, automatic climate control AC, company fitted infotainment screen on the central console, two entertainment screens at the rear for passengers, panoramic sunroof, automatic window curtains, small refrigerator, leather wrapped steering, leather seats, leather wrapped dashboard and door panels with wooden inserts on them.

Just like the exterior, the interior was also looking in mint condition. There is no wear and tear seen on any of the panels or parts of the car as well. The seller even shows the boot space and opens the bonnet to show the massive V8 petrol engine. The car like any other part, looks neat under the hood as well. The Mercedes Benz S500 is a 2011 model vehicle that has done approximately 81,000 kms on the odometer. The car is currently registered in Haryana and the asking price for this luxury sedan is Rs 9.95 lakh only. Which is actually a great deal considering the fact that a new one would cost over a crore.

There are certain things that a buyer should keep in mind while buying such luxury vehicles. It is always a better idea to have a closer look at the vehicle before making a final decision. Although, S Class is available at the price of a regular sedan, it is still a luxury car and if something goes wrong, it will be very expensive to repair. In comparison to a regular car, servicing and maintenance of such an expensive car will also be more.
