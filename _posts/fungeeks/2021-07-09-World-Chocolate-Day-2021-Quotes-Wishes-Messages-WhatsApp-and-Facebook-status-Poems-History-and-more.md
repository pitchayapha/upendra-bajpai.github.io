World Chocolate Day 2021: Poems

1.

Self-Employed

She is always asking

for more.

More hours making words,

more days finding

the things she loves—

people, art, a good font.

But she gives me

chocolates.

How can I say

no?

By L.L. Barkat

My little Chocolate Mess

Bathwater and bubbles are waiting,

but my child is nowhere near.

Yet, I can see from cookie crumbs,

he's crawled from here to there.

Oh, yes! he's been in the kitchen.

I see his crooked crumb trail,

which leads to our white kitten,

with a chocolate, sticky tail!

In every room I search

for my little chocolate mess.

Then, I find him in the my bedroom,

with his hands on my new dress!

By Faye Gibson

Chocolate Pleasure

Will you,Eat me; eat me,

please, like A piece,

of Reese's Pieces,

chocolate pleasure,

I melt in your mouth,

I am that Kit-Kat,

who will satisfy,

your whatchamacallit,

to make the Skor, on

Your Nutroll,

and go nutritiously,

nutrageous,

over my babyruth,

for you are, that mounds,

of full almond joy..
