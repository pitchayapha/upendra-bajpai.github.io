After SBI, Kotak Mahindra and HDFC, ICICI Bank slashes home loan rates

New Delhi: Private lender ICICI Bank joined the home loan rate cut bandwagon by announcing that it has cut rates to 6.70 per cent for loans up to Rs 75 lakh. The bank said that home loans above Rs 75 lakh will attract a rate of 6.75 per cent.

These revised rates will be available till March 31, 2021, the bank said.

This announcement comes after India's largest lender State Bank of India cut home loan rates to 6.70 per cent followed by announcements from Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC Ltd. SBI, HDFC cut home loan rates to 6.7 percent and 6.75 percent, while Kotak Mahindra cut home loan rates to 6.65 percent.

Ravi Narayanan, Head of Secured Assets at ICICI Bank said “We see resurgence in demand from consumers, who want to buy homes for their own consumption, in the past few months. We believe that this is an opportune time for an individual to buy their dream home, considering the prevailing low interest rates."

Announcing the cut, ICICI Bank said that home buyers, including those who are not its customers, can apply for home loan digitally through the bank’s website and mobile banking platform iMobile Pay.

According to analysts, the cut in home loan rates is temporary and is timed to attract customers while the benefit from the cuts in stamp duty are available. However, if demand from companies remains week in the quarters ahead, lenders might be compelled to under-cut each other in order to grow market share.

It is worth noting that in November 2020, ICICI Bank became the first private sector bank in the country to cross the Rs 2 lakh crore-mark in mortgage loan portfolio. Its mortgage disbursements increased in Q3-2021 over Q2-2021 and reached an all-time monthly high in December 2020, the bank said while announcing its third-quarter results.
