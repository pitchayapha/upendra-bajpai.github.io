It seems like the SUV is finished in a nice shade of silver which is a bit understated. The Turbo is currently the top-end variant of the Cayenne that is sold in India. Above Cayenne Turbo there is Cayenne Tubo S E-Hybrid and Cayenne Turbo GT. Both of these models are not yet on sale in our country. The Cayenne Turbo costs Rs. 1.93 Crores ex-showroom.

The Turbo variant of the Cayenne comes with a 4.0-litre V8 that has been twin-turbocharged. It produces 550 PS of max power and a peak torque output of 770 Nm. It is mated to an 8-speed automatic gearbox that drives all four wheels. It has a top speed of 286 kmph and it can hit a ton in just 4.1 seconds. If you opt-in for the Sports Chrono Package then the acceleration time further gets reduced to 3.9 seconds.

The twin-turbocharged V8 engine is a very versatile engine as it is being used by various manufacturers that fall under Volkswagen ownership. Audi is using it for RSQ8, RS7 and RS6 Avant. Bentley is using it for Bentayega and Continental GT. Porsche is already using the same engine in their Panamera. Even Lamborghini is using it for its Urus SUV.

Despite being more of a performance-oriented SUV, the Cayenne has a very good ground clearance of 190 mm which is enough to tackle bad Indian roads. Moreover, you can increase the ground clearance to 245 mm if you put the SUV in off-road mode. All this is possible because Porsche has equipped the Cayenne with an air suspension so you can increase or decrease the ride height.

Sachin also owns Porsche 911 Turbo S

The 911 is mostly bought by people who are automotive enthusiasts and like to drive themselves. This is because 911 is a proper sports car. Sachin Tendulkar was spotted driving a Porsche 911 Turbo S which is a more powerful variant of the regular 911.

The Turbo S variant produces 650 PS of max power and 800 Nm of peak torque from its twin-turbocharged six-cylinder engine. It has a top speed of 330 kmph and can hit a ton in just 2.7 seconds. All this power is transferred to all four wheels using an 8-speed PDK transmission which is one of the best in the automobile industry.

The wheels have a unique setup because the front wheels measure 20 inches while the rear one measures 21 inches. Braking duties are done by 10 piston calipers in the front and 4 piston calipers at the rear. The front discs measure a massive 420 mm whereas the rear discs measure 390 mm.
