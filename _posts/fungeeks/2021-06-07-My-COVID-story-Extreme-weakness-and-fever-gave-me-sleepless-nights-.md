It's astonishing to see how outlandish our world has become since the onset of COVID-19. There was a time when people could walk on the streets freely without any concerns or distress. Now, we are just doomed to a life of wretchedness and misery. The same streets that once took you to your destination might give you a disease that can take your life away in a flash. We are living in a dubious and uncertain world. But at long last, we need to have something to hope for in life. I am an 18-year-old guy from Patna, Bihar, India. Here is my COVID Journey. How I contracted the virus and what difference it made in my life.The COVID situation had calmed down in most parts of the country and my state by the end of 2020. By the time the first wave froze down, everyone was back to their usual routine. Schools, shops, and many other places that were closed for so many months finally reopened. Presuming that the raging contagion has dwindled, we sprang to our feet again. Experiencing the outside world at that time was a unique sensation. India's vaccination drive began gathering tremendous impulse. The elders in my family got their first dose of Covishield, which came as a source of indispensable relief. Everything seemed lucid until the end of March 2021. Then came the dreadful months of April and May that beheld the rise of the second wave of this enraged virus.Hearing the stories of the second wave on the internet and television often gave me chills. Everyone used to discuss how harmful it was and the new symptoms it dispensed. I caught COVID in the last week of April. And it was the worst week of my entire life.I began sensing body pain on 22nd April, and I had a feeling that this might be a symptom of the second wave of Coronavirus as I heard a lot about it from other people. I discussed it with my friends and family. In the end, I took it as a normal pain that comes from exercising as I used to train a lot at that time.On the morning of 23rd April, I was feeling dizzy when I woke up. I knew something was wrong, but I couldn't figure it out. I was experiencing a severe headache and body pain that was unbearable. My mom touched me and said, "You have a fever". It was at this moment, a string of cynical images blazed before my eyes. I remember asking a close friend of mine about this, and how he facetiously replied, "it must be COVID". Failing to accept the truth and assuming that it's just ordinary flu, I slept for some more time. Upon waking up, I found out that my sister was also going through the same body pain. I had a bad feeling since the beginning of all this but was too startled to endure the fate. It began to look obvious now. Still, we were not sure about anything. I took the usual medicine prescribed for a high temperature. And after one capsule of Paracetamol, my fever went away for a few minutes. I felt enthusiastic and relieved. I told everyone that I think it is a common flu and body pain is just an eventuality. But then, the dizziness came back. The return of that woozy feeling prompted me to reconsider things. Life was acting as a scapegrace to me. I started recording my body temperature. I had a persistent fever of 99 degrees throughout the day. And whenever it crossed 100, I used to take one capsule of Paracetamol. I took a total of three capsules of Paracetamol in a single day. The night of 23rd April petrifies me to this day. It is too difficult to describe the discomfort I felt while sleeping that night. The weakness went to such a sickening degree that I had to take the aid of a wall to turn my body while sleeping. I couldn't even turn my body on my own. It was when my fever stretched to 102 degrees that I kept my skepticism aside and started following the remedies for COVID. On 24th April, I lost my sense of taste and smell. It was a bewildering impression. The exasperation of not being able to smell or taste anything at all was truly troublesome. By this time, I started looking for available slots in nearby labs to get tested. Another day passed on with the same adhesive fatigue. At that time, like everyone, we too purchased an oximeter. I recall the first time I examined my oxygen level with that pulse oximeter. In the dusk of 24th April, I stuck my fingertip inside the pulse oximeter for the first time. It came out to be alternating between 84 and 88. "It should not go below 92 or 93," people said. I checked it again and again until it showed 95-96. Performed some quick natural remedies, steam inhalation, and drank tons of insipid decoct. It was a hell of a time.On 26th April, the phlebotomist collected the sample from my home. And the results came on 28th April. Before jumping on to the result day, let's talk about the day of sample collection. The RT PCR test was a little uncomfortable and disturbing. The moment they push the nasal swab inside your nostrils, the teardrops kick in. I authoritatively tested positive for COVID on 28th April 2021. But it was not a surprise to me as I apprehended it much before even taking the test. Due to diligent anticipation and medications, I was able to stop my fever. However, the weakness persevered for a few more days. I regained my lost sense of taste and smell in a month and developed antibodies in the process.What I want to say here is, don't squander your time in attempting to surmise your situation. Had I been waiting for the results of RT PCR without taking any therapeutic anticipations for COVID specifically, I could have ended up in a hospital or a much worse situation. "Never let your guard down" is what the health workers say. No matter how strong the pandemic is, we can fight it with proper watchfulness and awareness.
