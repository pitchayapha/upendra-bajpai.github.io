The central government is not keen on cutting excise duty levied on fuel, even as petrol and diesel prices remain at record levels across the country.

At the moment, taxes levied on petrol and diesel in the country are the highest in the world. It may be noted that the Centre charges Rs 32.90 per litre as excise duty on petrol and Rs 31.80 per litre on diesel.

In recent interactions, top government officials indicated that it would difficult for the central government to cut excise duty levied on fuel prices, citing higher expenses incurred during the Covid-19 pandemic.

A few days ago, Union Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said the government’s expenditure has increased during the second wave of the pandemic due to vaccinations and other welfare schemes.

He also blamed some states for charging high value-added tax (VAT). Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana are some states where VAT rates are higher in comparison to the national average of Rs 23 per litre.

Meanwhile, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman maintains that the Centre and states have to discuss the situation as it involves both parties.

However, even states are not keen on cutting VAT they charge on fuel, citing the present economic condition. They also blame the Centre for charging high excise duty on petrol and diesel.

As the situation stands, both the central government and states agree that fuel prices are high but have not come up with a plan to reduce the burden on citizens. The burden could increase if international crude oil prices keep rising.

NO PROPOSAL FROM STATES ON GST INCLUSION

While reducing high taxes on fuel is one way to reduce fuel prices, including petroleum productions under Goods and Services Tax (GST) is another way.

The finance minister recently said there is no hurdle from the Centre’s side to include petroleum products under GST, but added that the GST Council has the sole authority to take a call on the matter. The GST Council is a joint forum of Centre and states, headed by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

Several reports suggest that states are reluctant to bring petroleum products under GST. It seems that states also do not want to lose out on revenues as the VAT they generate from fuel sales much higher than what they would earn under the highest tax slab (28 per cent) of the GST.

Given the circumstances, a decision to bring petroleum products under GST also seems a far cry and citizens may have no choice but to deal with higher fuel prices. Their only hope is a reduction in international crude oil prices.

In what seems to be a slight ray of hope, international crude oil prices have fallen sharply over the past couple of days due to rising uncertainty amid rising Covid-19 cases and a failed meeting of OPEC+ nations.

It may be noted that petrol price has already crossed Rs 100 per litre in two dozen cities including Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai and Mumbai. Diesel price has also crossed the three-figure mark in Rajasthan's Sri Ganganagar and remains above Rs 90 per litre in most other cities.
