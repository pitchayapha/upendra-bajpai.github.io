Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) share price rose nearly 2 percent in the early trade on January 8 ahead of its third quarter result which is expected today.

The country's largest IT services exporter is expected to report strong revenue growth of more than 2.5 percent in constant currency quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) and over 3 percent growth QoQ in dollar revenue led by large deal wins in Q3 FY21.

Although margin may get impacted by wage revision.
