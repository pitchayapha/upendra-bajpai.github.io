Paytm parent One97 Communications' shares returned to green territory on Friday after sliding below the Rs 1,000 mark for the first time ever. Paytm shares ended 8.4 percent higher for the day at Rs 1,118.4 on BSE, recovering after hitting a record low of Rs 995 during the session.

The Paytm stock has made a series of lows in the past few sessions, and failed to cross the issue price since its secondary market debut on November 18. At the latest record low, Paytm shares changed hands at a discount of 53.7 percent to the issue price of Rs 2,150.

Paytm Co-Founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma has said that the company's IPO came at a time when global markets were already risk-averse due to a confluence of factors, which affected its performance.

“Globally, we probably went in at a time when QE, free money and many other parameters brought a little spook out of the market. South American companies are over 70 percent down. That’s not the reason completely. That’s a macro reason,” he said at the IAMAI’s India Digital Summit 2022.
