InterGlobe Aviation share price slipped 4 percent on July 28, a day after the reported its result for the quarter ended June 2021. The company posted a loss of Rs 3,174.2 crore in Q1 FY22, compared to a loss of Rs 2,844.3 crore in the year-ago period. Its revenue from operations stood at Rs 3,006.9 crore, up 292.2 percent from Q1 FY21 due to low base.

Goldman Sachs | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,850 | The brokerage has slashed its FY22 estimates. However, it believes the aviation giant stands out versus its competition. Goldman Sachs expects IndiGo to launch Rs 3,000 crore QIP soon given cash burn during the quarter.

Morgan Stanley | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 2,292 | The near-term earnings are tough to predict. However, competitive lead on the customer and cost fronts and valuation keep us overweight, said Morgan Stanley.

Credit Suisse | Rating: Outperform | Target: Rs 2,100 | Credit Suisse revised EPS to â€“Rs 77/+Rs 63 for FY22/ 23. The consolidation may play out given the scale of damage to peers & ensuing lessors disputes. The company seemed less than 100% sure of QIP, but it still is very likely, it added.
