In a boost to Uttar Pradesh (UP)'s efforts to attract mobile manufacturing firms to set up factories in the state, electronics contract manufacturer Optiemus Infracom is set to establish a "world-class factory" for mobile manufacturing in Noida, reports Financial Express.

While the company already has an old operational factory in Noida, the new plant would be equipped with latest technologies and will most likely be made operational by 1 February 2020. The company has already placed orders for new machines for the upcoming factory.

It should be noted that Optiemus is one of the 16 firms who have been selected by the government as beneficiaries under its production linked incentives (PLI) scheme for large scale electronics manufacturing. The scheme was notified on 1 April earlier this year.

Other domestic firms which have been selected under the scheme include Lava International, Bhagwati (Micromax), Padget Electronics (Dixon Technologies) and UTL Neolyncs.

Among international firms who have been selected under PLI are iPhone maker Apple Incâ€™s contract manufacturers Foxconn Hon Hai, Wistron and Pegatron, apart from Samsung and Rising Star.
