Key Highlights Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a type of herpes virus that is highly transmissible One of the most common cause of infectious mononucleosis is the Epstein-Barr virus Recent studies have also found link between the Epstein-Barr virus and COVID-19

A 12-year-old Canadian boy was diagnosed with the Epstein Barr virus that caused his tongue to turn yellow. According to a report published in The New England Journal of Medicine titled 'An Icteric Tongue', “A 12-year-old boy presented with a 4-day history of sore throat and dark urine. He was found to have jaundice with an icteric tongue, and the haemoglobin level was 6.1 g per deciliter. A diagnosis of cold agglutinin, EBV-induced acute hemolytic anaemia was made.”

“After discharge, he recovered well, and the tongue icterus gradually resolved as the bilirubin levels normalized.”, the report added.

Epstein-Barr virus - Symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), also known as human herpesvirus 4, is a member of the herpes virus family. It is one of the most common human viruses. EBV is found all over the world. Most people get infected with EBV at some point in their lives. EBV spreads most commonly through bodily fluids, primarily saliva. EBV can cause infectious mononucleosis, also called mono, and other illnesses.” The common symptoms of Epstein-Barr virus include:

Fever

Rashes

Fatigue

Body ache

Sore throat

Headache

Swollen liver

Swollen neck lymph nodes

Spleen swelling

Loss of appetite

The diagnosis of this condition requires assessment of the symptoms and blood tests. There is no vaccine available for the Epstein-Barr virus therefore, treatment methods require fluid intake, over-the-counter medication consumptions, and bed rest. The Epstein-Barr virus is a highly transmissible disease and can spread through physical contact with an infected person in form of kissing, food and drink sharing, or bodily fluid exchange. It is essential to carry precautionary methods to ensure the prevention of its spread.

Epstein-Barr virus and COVID-19

According to a study published in Pathogens titled “Investigation of Long COVID Prevalence and Its Relationship to Epstein-Barr Virus Reactivation”, reactivation of the Epstein-Barr virus may contribute to the development of severe COVID-19 and long COVID-19 cases and symptoms.

Jeffrey E. Gold of the World Organization and the lead author of the study said, "We ran Epstein-Barr virus serological tests on COVID-19 patients at least 90 days after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, comparing EBV reactivation rates of those with long COVID symptoms to those who never experienced long COVID symptoms. We found over 73% of COVID-19 patients who were experiencing long Covid symptoms were also positive for EBV reactivation."

David J. Hurley, PhD, a professor and molecular microbiologist at the University of Georgia and co-author of the study said, "We found similar rates of EBV reactivation in those who had long COVID symptoms for months, as in those with long COVID symptoms that began just weeks after testing positive for COVID-19. This indicated to us that EBV reactivation likely occurs simultaneously or soon after COVID-19 infection."
