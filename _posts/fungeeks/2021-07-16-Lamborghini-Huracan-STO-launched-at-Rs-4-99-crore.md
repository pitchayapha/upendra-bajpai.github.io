Lamborghini has launched the Huracan STO in India at a price of Rs. 4.99 crore (ex-showroom).

The Huracan STO is the most track-focused version of the Huracan. 'STO' stands for 'Super Trofeo Omologata'. It was developed by the Squadra Corse racing division, as a race car for the road.

The Huracan STO has a one-piece front clamshell with louvres on the front fenders. It gets a large front splitter and a massive adjustable rear spoiler, among other aerodynamic upgrades. It has a dry weight of 1,339 kg. Compared to the Huracan Performante, the overall weight of the car is lesser by 43 kg.

On the inside, the STO comes with carbon-backed sports seats, carbon door panels with lightweight door pulls and carbon-weaved floor mats.

The STO is powered by a 5.2-litre, V10 engine that develops 631 BHP and 565 Nm. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Lamborghini claims that the STO can accelerate from 0-100 km/h in 3.0 seconds. Its top speed is rated at 310 km/h.

On the chassis side, the Huracan STO gets stiffer springs and anti-roll bars, a wider track, rear-wheel steering and ceramic brakes. It has three driving modes - STO, Trophy and Rain.
