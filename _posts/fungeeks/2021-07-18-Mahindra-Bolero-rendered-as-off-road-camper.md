Mahindra Bolero is usually bought by people who will be using it on tough terrains and want a rugged vehicle. The Bolero is also one of the most reliable SUVs that you can buy. People have been using it for years as an affordable off-roader and the design of the SUV has also not changed much. Here, is a rendering done by _kenei_luho_designs_. He has imagined the SUV as an off-roader camper.

The artist has used a hybrid of Bolero and Bolero Pik-up. Bolero Pik-up is offered only with two doors and with a flatbed whereas the Bolero SUV comes with four doors. The render uses a Bolero with four doors and a flatbed. So, it is the best of both worlds. You can have the cabin space of a four-door vehicle with the practicality of a flatbed.

There are a lot of upgrades that we can see in the pictures. There is a front skid plate and a metal bumper. The skid plates protect the radiator and other engine parts and the front bumper protects the SUV. There are LED auxiliary lamps mounted behind the mental bumper and on the roof that helps in illuminating the road ahead while off-roading.

Other things that we noticed include a lift kit, off-road tyres with black alloy wheels. Side steps are also there to help in easy ingress and egress. We can also see limb risers that prevent the tree branches from scratching the paint as well as hitting the windshield.

Bolero Neo

Mahindra launched a new version of Bolero recently. It is a facelifted version of the TUV300 that has now been renamed Bolero Neo. Mahindra is aiming it towards people who want a rugged compact SUV that can tackle slightly rough terrains. The Bolero Neo is based on the ladder frame chassis that is shared with the Scorpio and Thar. It is a rear-wheel-drive vehicle and it comes with a lockable differential. When compared all the competitors are based on a monocoque chassis and are front-wheel drive.

So, the Bolero Neo is the only rugged compact SUV that you can buy in the Indian market. The interior is also utilitarian with no soft-touch materials and it is only offered with fabric or vinyl seats. Bolero Neo is for a buyer who is looking for reliability and ruggedness without sacrificing too much on modern features.

So, Bolero Neo still comes with a touchscreen infotainment system, multi-information display, front and rear armrest, multi-function steering wheel, power windows, dual-tone interior, micro-hybrid technology, Eco mode and much more. The Bolero neo is also a 7-seater SUV. There are two side-facing seats that act as a third-row.

It is offered only with a 1.5-litre diesel engine that produces 100 PS of max power and a peak torque output of 260 Nm. It is offered only with a 5-speed manual gearbox that drives the rear wheels. You can get the lockable differential in the top-end N10(O) variant. The Bolero Neo starts at Rs. 8.48 lakhs ex-showroom and goes up to Rs. 9.99 lakhs ex-showroom.
