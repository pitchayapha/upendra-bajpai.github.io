The Income-Tax departmentâ€™s investigation wing is conducting a survey at around 15 offices of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited (ZEEL) and Larsen and Toubro (L&T) on the basis of a disclosure provided by the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Department.

The disclosure, sources said, was regarding input tax credit availed by the Zee Group and L&T. I-T Department sources said that they are verifying the input tax credit availed by the two companies. ZEEL is the entertainment wing of the Zee Group.

The disclosure from the GST Department was received recently by the I-T Department, based on which the survey started on Monday morning. I-T Department officials said they may direct action if any tax evasion is found in the survey.

A spokesperson from the Zee Group said, "The officials from the tax department have visited the offices of the company, with certain queries. The concerned officials of the company are providing all the required information and extending complete co-operation".
