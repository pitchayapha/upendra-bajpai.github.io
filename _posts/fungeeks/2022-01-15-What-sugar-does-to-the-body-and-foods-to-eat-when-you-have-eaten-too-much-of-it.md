As we told you earlier in this article that most of the food we eat has some form of sugar in them and we often consume it unknowingly. So, here we list some of the foods that you must eat after you have had too much of sugar like desserts.

Protein-rich foods: When you consume too much of sugar, your blood sugar might spike and you might not feel normal. Thus, it is recommended that you must eat slow-digesting protein like a hard-boiled egg, nut butter, pistachios and even hummus.

Fibre-rich foods: You must stabilize your blood sugar by consuming fibre-rich foods like apples, raw vegetables, beans, lentils and even fruits like berries and avocado. You can also have chia soaked water as it contains a lot of fibre, more than you can even imagine.

Probiotic foods: One of the studies by Oregon State University stated that when there is a ‘bad’ bacteria present in your gut, it feeds on the sugar and can even affect your cognitive function. So, if you think you’ve had too much of sugar recently, have some probiotic foods like Greek yoghurt, kombucha, sauerkraut or even cultured cottage cheese. Consuming these foods can really help you feel a little better.
