Since early last year, when the coronavirus was spreading its wings across the globe, a growing volume of losses have been observed caused by increasingly sophisticated scams. To create awareness about the same among their customer, the State Bank of India (SBI) has issued a warning to beware of cyber fraudsters.

Althoughcomplete security cannot be guaranteed in online transactions, hackers are always able to find a way to break into peopleâ€™s accounts and steal their money. In their latest tweet, SBI has requested customers to not fall prey to links that promise gifts or cash of any kind. The bank asked them to not click on such links as cyber fraudsters can be behind it.

SBI also cautioned people to not download apps on their smartphones or computer systems, which promote any sort of phishing. Customers were suggested to check the authenticity, reviews, and comments of an app before downloading it.
