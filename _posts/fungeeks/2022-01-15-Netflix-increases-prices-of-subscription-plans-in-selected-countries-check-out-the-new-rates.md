Netflix subscription plans have become costlier in some countries. While the streaming giant recently reduced the rates of its monthly and yearly plans in India, the company has increased the rates in the United States and Canada. The company announced that the monthly subscription prices will go up by $1 to $2 in the US depending on the plan. In India, Netflix has been really considerate. In a bid to attract new subscribers, Netflix has slashed the prices of its subscription plans in India. The monthly plan starts at Rs 149 in India.

The basic plan in the United States, which allows only one screen at a time, costs 9.99 dollars. The price of the standard plan has been increased to $15.50 per month from $14. The standard plan allows two screens at a time. The price of the 4K plan will rise to $20 per month from $18. This plan allows four screens at a time. The price of the basic plan has also been increased by $1.

Netflix had also increased the prices of its subscription plans in Canada. The standard plan in Canada has been increased to C$16.49 from C$14.99. The premium plan has been hiked from C$2 to C$20.99. However, Netflix has not increased the price of the basic plan. It remains unchanged at C$9.99.

“We’re updating our prices so that we can continue to offer a wide variety of quality entertainment options,” a Netflix spokesperson told Reuters. “As always we offer a range of plans so members can pick a price that works for their budget.”
