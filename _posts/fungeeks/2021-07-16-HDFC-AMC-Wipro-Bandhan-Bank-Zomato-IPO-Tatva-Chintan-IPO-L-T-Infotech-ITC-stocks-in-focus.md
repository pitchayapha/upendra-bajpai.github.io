Emergence of strong upside momentum above 15950 is expected to open next higher levels of 16100 in the short term, said an analyst

Nifty futures were trading 36 points or 0.23 per cent up at 15,957 on Singaporean Exchange, suggesting a gap-up opening for BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 on Friday. Investors will continue to track Q1 results, COVID vaccination drive, stock-specific action, oil prices, rupee movement against US dollar and other global developments. As Nifty 50 broke above the resistance of 15,900, analysts expect the index to touch 16,000 levels soon. “The lack of strength in the upside momentum at the hurdle and poor market breadth of Thursday could raise doubt on a decisive upside breakout of larger consolidation band at 15920-15950 levels. Emergence of strong upside momentum above 15950 is expected to open next higher levels of 16100 in the short term,” said Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities.
