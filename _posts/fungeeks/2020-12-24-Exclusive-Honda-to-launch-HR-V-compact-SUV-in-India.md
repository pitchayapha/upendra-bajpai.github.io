Honda Cars India yesterday made an announcement that they are discontinuing two vehicles from their portfolio in Indian market. According to the new announcement, Honda will not be selling Honda Civic premium sedan and Honda CR-V SUV. Honda City is now officially the most expensive model that Honda will be selling in India. As part of this new product realignment process, Honda is planning to launch a new compact SUV for the Indian market. CarToq sources indicate that Honda is preparing to launch the HR-V in India to rival with the likes of Hyundai Creta. Honda will be launching the third gen HR-V compact SUV in the market.

Honda is busy testing the all-new third generation HR-V SUV internationally. Currently an exact date of launch is not available but, is expected to be launched some time later next year. This might actually be a good move because, sub-4 meter compact and compact SUV segments are quite popular in the Indian market.

Honda was already considering to launch the HR-V in Indian market after seeing the popularity of SUVs here and our source suggests that it will be launched. Introducing HR-V in the market will allow Honda to expand their product portfolio. Earlier this year Honda launched the fifth generation Honda City and had not discontinued the fourth generation in order to expand the portfolio.

Talking about Honda HR-V, it is already available in the international market and the current version is already at the end of its life cycle and is unlikely to come to India. We are expected to get the all-new third gen HR-V that will be launched internationally next year. It is a 5-seater SUV and will occupy the space that Honda BR-V has left vacant. This could actually be a game changer for Honda in India if they price it competitively.

The next-gen Honda HR-V is expected to get signature Honda nose grille with LED headlamps, wide front grille and so on. It will be a premium looking SUV just like Hyundai Creta. Just like any other SUV in the segment, it would get thick claddings around the wheel arches, dual tone machine cut alloy wheels and a muscular looking rear with LED tail lights. In terms of looks, the HR-V is expected to look more like a crossover than an SUV.

On the inside, it will be offering all the features that a modern day Honda car offers. It will get a touchscreen infotainment system that supports Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. It might even offer connect car features like new gen Honda City. The current generation HR-V is available four engine options. There is a 1.5 litre turbo petrol, 1.5 litre turbo petrol hybrid and 1.8 liter naturally aspirated petrol units, and a 1.5 liter turbocharged diesel. With the third gen HR-V the same engine options are expected to continue.

In India, Honda is expected to bring the 1.8 litre naturally aspirated petrol, 1.5 litre petrol hybrid and 1.5 litre diesel engine options. There is also a possibility that Honda might introduce the 1.5 litre turbo petrol variant at a later stage. HR-V will be available with a manual and automatic gearbox option.
