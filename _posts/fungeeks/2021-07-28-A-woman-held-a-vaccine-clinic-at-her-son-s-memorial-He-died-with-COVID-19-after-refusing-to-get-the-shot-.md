"But he did not tell his friends all the underlying health conditions he had," Antoine told CBS. She told the network that she felt "angry" after he died - "not so much at him, but because he did not take the vaccine," she said. "And I said right there, I'm going to ask his friends and everybody to take that vaccine in honor of him."

At his "celebration of life" service in Port Allen on July 18, Antoine organized for vaccines to be offered to those attending, Louisiana newspaper The Advocate reported.

Three people took up the offer on the day, according to CBS.
