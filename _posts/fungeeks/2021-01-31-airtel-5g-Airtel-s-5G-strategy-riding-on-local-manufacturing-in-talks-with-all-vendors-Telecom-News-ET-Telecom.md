NEW DELHI: Bharti Airtel said that "make in India" is an important part of its 5G strategy in the country and it is in talks with all equipment partners for radio and transport network to start local manufacturing to support its 5G roll out.The Sunil Mittal-led telco's top two radio equipment partners Ericsson and Nokia have already given assurity to supply 5G radio equipment from their respective Pune and Chennai manufacturing facilities."Make in India is an important part of our 5G strategy Ericsson and Nokia are already making 5G in India for global customers and will also provide us with 5G equipment from local factories," Randeep Sekhon , chief technology office at Airtel told ET."Our Transport partners are now bringing manufacturing to India for 5G. We are in talks with all partners. Once 5G starts, we will need locally made equipment," he added.Airtel is currently in talks with US-based Flex to make 5G gear and home-bred Tejas Networks for wireline products. It is asking its partners like Nokia, Ciena and Cisco to locally produce crucial core and transport equipment. “One of them has agreed to locally manufacture IP and optical products,” an executive previously told ETBharti Airtel is also developing 5G network technologies in India through own R&D and in collaboration with local, US and Japanese firms.A complete local 5G ecosystem and own capability to develop telecom gear will allow Airtel to have a better control over the supply chain and reduce overall network deployment costs by looking beyond traditional vendors that charge premium for their products and technology, analysts said.Under its Make in India strategy, Airtel is planning to bring a large ecosystem of partners including US’s Mavenir, Xilinx and Altiostar (part owned by Japan’s Rakuten), Japan’s NEC and Taiwan’s Sercom that will help the telco develop equipment using OpenRAN technology.
