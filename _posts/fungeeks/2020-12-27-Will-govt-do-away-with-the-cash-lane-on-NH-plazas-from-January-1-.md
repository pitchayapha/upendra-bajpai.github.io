NEW DELHI: The toll collection through FASTag crossed Rs 80 crore for the first time on Thursday with a record 50 lakh transactions , according to the National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ). Sources said the government is also considering whether it can do away with the “hybrid lanes” at toll plazas from January 1. Cash is accepted from commuters on these lanes.

The hybrid lanes also are fitted with the device that can read the FASTags. The transactions for paying toll through FASTag has increased to nearly 78% and still a significant share of commuters prefer paying cash for the toll charges.

“Once the government does away with the hybrid lane and notifies all lanes as ‘FASTag lanes’, commuters paying cash would have to pay double of the notified toll charge. None would like to pay a higher toll. That’s why we have increased deployment of people at toll plazas for sale and installation of FASTags on the spot. It takes hardly five minutes,” said an NHAI official.

According to NHAI, FASTag is easily available at over 30,000 points of sale (PoS) across the country and these are available at all NHAI toll plazas. It is also available online. They said a cash recharge facility is also being provided at PoS at toll plazas for convenience of users.

The government has made it mandatory for all four-wheelers and bigger vehicles to have functional FASTag from January 1 and violation of this will be treated as an offence under the motor vehicle law. FASTag has also been made mandatory for renewal of insurance for four wheelers and bigger vehicles and renewal of fitness certificate for commercial vehicles from next April.
