Tesla’s call for a cut in duty on imported electric cars has prompted heads of other to react. On Tuesday, Cabs founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal said he was not in favour of the government paring duty on imported Aggarwal’s comments went viral on the micro blogging platform Twitter after reports that Elon Musk’s Inc had sought a lower duty on imported EVs.

SS Kim, managing director of Hyundai India, added his bit to back on the duty cut issue in an interview to Autocar India. “Lower duties will help grow the EV market,” Kim told the magazine.

Taking on the two industry majors, Aggarwal said he believed that India should have confidence in its own ability to build EVs indigenously. ‘’Strongly disagree with both. Let’s have confidence in our ability to build indigenously and also attract global OEMs to build in India, not just import. We won’t be the first country to do so," he tweeted.

Luxury carmakers including Mercedes Benz India, Audi India and Jaguar Land Rover have launched their EVs in India. Hyundai sells the Kona electric and MG the ZVS.

India levies a duty of more than 100 per cent on imported vehicles. Owing to a high sticker price, the volumes have been limited.
