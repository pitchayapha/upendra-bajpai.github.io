Effects of COVID 19 on Cancer Patients

Having cancer can raise your chances of severe illness from COVID-19, said Dr Agre in a statement. He explained, "Those taking chemotherapy has lowered blood counts and is immunosuppressed and more vulnerable to Covid-19 disease. Cancer tends to depress the body's immune system, and more cancer patients are older which is also a risk factor for Covid. Since COVID-19 can attack the lungs and invite acute respiratory failure, people with lung cancer are at an increased risk of contracting Covid infection, as their lung function is already compromised. Not only this, some advanced cancers impact organ function, such as lung or kidney function. With reduced organ function, people find it difficult to fight Covid infection."
