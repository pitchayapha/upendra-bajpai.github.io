Chest pain is a feeling of discomfort in and around the chest. It can either be triggered due to an inflammation in the heart or a non-heart-related condition.

Cardiac chest pain is commonly caused due to an irregular blood and oxygen supply in the heart muscles. Also known as Angina, you may experience a lot of pressure in your chest and the discomfort may spread to your shoulders, arms, neck and back.

Non-cardiac chest pain can be caused by many factors ranging from infections to muscle or bone complications. However, they may also require emergency help.
