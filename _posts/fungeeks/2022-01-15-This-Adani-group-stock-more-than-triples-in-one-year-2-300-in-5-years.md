Shares of billionaire Gautam Adani-led Adani Enterprises (AEL) have been surging for the past two days after the group flagship company signed a pact with South Korean steel major POSCO to explore business cooperation opportunities, including setting up a green, environment-friendly integrated steel plant in Mundra, Gujarat. The largecap stock is trading at a premium compared to its average historical valuations and has risen 1.82% in the last two sessions.

Adani Enterprises, which operates in a diversified sector, has delivered strong returns to shareholders in the last one year, thanks to fundamentals and constant business expansion in fields such as renewable energy, logistics, data centers, and green hydrogen, among others.
