Mumbai: In his open letter to more than seven lakh employees, in this Covid-hit year, Tata Sons' chairman N Chandrasekaran said though the year has been hard it is a year that has made him prouder of the work done by employees. "From delivering meals to migrant and health-workers, to building hospitals and collecting public health data, to our efforts to develop a pathbreaking CRISPR test for Covid-19-we have seen the very best of 'One Tata'. Your work this year has made me prouder than ever to lead this Group," he said.

He said though the year has been buried in the stress and trauma of covid-19 are opportunities for renewal. "We are, I hope, on the threshold of a new era of co-operation, in which individuals, businesses and nations more readily join forces," said Chandra in his message, adding that the distribution of covid vaccines in countries across the world will be an international operation of unparalleled complexity.

Chandrasekaran said the pandemic has rewritten the rules and there has been a shift in priorities with a greater focus on safety and resilience, and a transition from 'just in time' toward 'just in case' -- changes that "offer a glimpse of the new economy that will emerge from the old".

Reiterating that pandemics have, in the past, inspired progress in medicine, urban planning, architecture and countless other fields, Chandrasekaran said, "This one will be the same. This moment is akin to walking on a bridge, but it's a special bridge because we are not simply waiting to see what is on the other side. Instead, we have a hand in building our destination."

This March, the Tata Group--Tata Trusts and Tata Sons-- together decided to donate Rs 1,500 crore towards the coronavirus relief fund.

The funds, the group had said, will be utilised to provide protective equipment to medical personnel, respiratory systems, testing kits, and setting up treatment facilities. The group had also said it will train health workers and the general public in the fight against coronavirus.
