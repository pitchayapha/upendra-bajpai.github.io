Doctors fear a cocktail infection wave of Covid in the country due to the rapid mutation of the virus.

The danger of the four coronavirus variants apart from the newest Delta Plus variant is looming over Uttar Pradesh and medical experts are warning about the possibility of a 'cocktail infection wave' due to these variants.

According to the SN Medical College doctors, these four variants are the B.1.617.3, Delta variant B.1.617.2, B.1.1.318, and C.37, out of which C.37 or the 'Lambda' variant has been found in several countries and if air travel to India is reopened from these countries, this variant could enter India.

The said the Kappa variant B.1.617.1 is also being observed closely, although it has been the least infectious compared to the Delta or Delta Plus variants. B.1.617.3 and B.1.1.318 variants are already in India, but there has been no case reported of the Lambda variant yet.

The Lambda variant is spreading rapidly in other countries of the world and a cocktail of all these variants could bring another infection wave.

A senior pulmonologist told Indiatoday.in that the identification and categorisation of each new mutated variant of the coronavirus are important through the use of genomics.

Senior physician Dr. SK Kalra said the mutations in this virus are a cause of concern as each mutation is becoming more and more infectious.

The British health agency Public Health England (PHE) has issued an advisory recently about the Lambda variant and genome sequencing in India should be increased to find out if there are any cases of the Lambda variant in India.

Dr. Kalra said that the Lambda variant is not only highly infectious but can also neutralise the antibodies inside a person, so it becomes imperative to test the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccines against this new variant.
