Jeff Bezos, the world's richest person, is set to ride his rocket to outer space on Tuesday.

Bezos's Blue Origin company will launch its first crewed mission on its New Shepard rocket on July 20.

Bezos and three crewmates are due to fly from a desert site in West Texas on an 11-minute trip to the edge of space aboard Blue Origin's New Shepard, a 60-foot-tall (18.3 meters) and fully autonomous rocket-and-capsule combo. The flight represents an important milestone in the establishment of the space tourism industry.

Blue Origin on Tuesday tweeted, "Our astronauts have completed training and are a go for launch".

Our first human flight on Tuesday will be the 16th flight in #NewShepard’s history. Learn about the meticulous & rigorous launch program that brought us to this first step.
