Having rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is known to at least double the chances of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) because of links to atherosclerosis (a build-up of plaque inside the arteries), heart failure and strokes. The study, published in the journal Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, linked treatment of RA with improvements in vascular stiffness - an indicator of CVD. “Our research shows that even at the earliest stages of rheumatoid arthritis, there is increased vascular stiffness in people with no or minimal traditional CVD risk factors such as hypertension, high cholesterol or smoking,” said study author Sven Plein from the University of Leeds in the UK. For the study, the research team had set out to explore possible connections between the very earliest signs of RA and indicators of CVD. Detailed MRI heart scans were given to 82 patients with no known heart issues. The scans revealed the presence of increased vascular stiffness in the aorta, which is a gradual loss of elasticity in the large arteries, compared to healthy people. There was also evidence of cardiac scarring and changes in the wall of the left ventricle (the heart’s main pumping chamber), suggesting heart abnormalities had started before the RA diagnosis. After their initial scans, the 82 patients were given one of two RA drug courses. After a year of treatment, further scans were then carried out on 71 of the patients. The scans revealed that the vascular stiffness of the aorta (the main artery) had improved during the RA therapy. “The rheumatoid arthritis treatment improved vascular stiffness, regardless of how the patient responded to the RA medication and these improvements in vascular stiffness independently of response to RA treatment were unexpected,” Plein said. The research highlights the importance of commencing treatment of RA early to also lessen the risk of developing CVD. “Identifying patients at the earliest stage of RA with most risk of CVD is important to inform management strategy,” said study researcher Maya Buch. “The benefits of RA treatment on CVD extend beyond traditional suppression of inflammation,” Buch noted.

    "body": "2020/09/08 - Glucoregulatory neurons within the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus-median eminence of the brain are enmeshed by extracellular matrices known as perineuronal nets that can profoundly impact neuronal function. Latest findings implicate these structures in both brain control of glucose homeostasis and as potential targets for diabetes treatment. Credit: KImberly Alonge/Schwartz Lab/UW Medicine Diabetes Research Institute In rodents with type 2 diabetes, a single surgical injection of a protein called fibroblast growth factor 1 can restore blood sugar levels to normal for weeks or months. Yet how this growth factor acts in the brain to generate this lasting benefit has been poorly understood. Clarifying how this occurs might lead to more effective diabetes treatments that tap into the brain’s inherent potential to ameliorate the condition. “Until recently, the brain’s ability to normalize elevated blood sugar levels in diabetic animals was unrecognized,” said Dr. Michael Schwartz, professor of medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine and co-director of the UW Medicine Diabetes Institute. “By interrogating cellular and molecular responses induced in the hypothalamus by a brain peptide called fibroblast growth factor 1, our international teams’ latest findings chart a path towards a more complete understanding how this effect is achieved. “These insights,” he said, “may one day inform therapeutic strategies for inducing sustained diabetes remission, rather than simply lowering blood sugar levels on a day-to-day basis as current treatments do. ” Type 2 diabetes affects 10% of the U. S. population. It is closely tied to obesity and causes serious health problems including heart disease, vision loss, kidney failure, dementia, difficult-to-cure infections, and nerve damage. It also increases the risk of needing amputations. Control of blood sugar levels can prevent these problems, but is often hard to achieve and becomes an ongoing struggle for many patients. In two companion papers in the Sept. 7 editions of Nature Communications and Nature Metabolism, international teams of researchers describe the intricate biology of the brain’s response to fibroblast growth factor 1. The first team describes robust cellular responses that appear to safeguard brain-signaling pathways critical to keeping blood sugar in check. A second team, containing some of the same researchers, made discoveries about extracellular matrix assemblies called “perineuronal nets” that enmesh groups of neurons involved in blood sugar control. The investigators learned that fibroblast growth factor 1 repairs perineuronal nets that have been damaged by diabetes. This response is required for diabetes remission to be sustained. Dr. Tunes Pers, of the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, University of Copenhagen in Denmark, and diabetes and obesity researcher Dr. Michael Schwartz at UW Medicine in Seattle were senior authors of the Nature Communications report. The lead authors from their labs were Dr. Marie Bentsen and Dr. Dylan Rausch. The international team of scientists that they assembled began by detailing changes of gene expression induced by fibroblast growth factor 1 treatment across diverse brain cell types located in the hypothalamus. This small region of the brain regulates many body functions, including levels of blood sugar, hunger, food intake, and energy use and storage. The scientists found that glial cells, which not only provide structural support but also help to organize and regulate neurocircuit activity, responded more intensely than did neurons, brain cells known for electrical transmission of information. The researchers also observed enhanced interactions between astrocytes and a subset of neurons that make agouti-related protein (called Agrp neurons). Astrocytes are abundant, star-shaped glial cells that nourish neurons and support their electrical transmissions. Agrp neurons are essential components of the melanocortin signaling system, a brain circuit crucial to control of feeding, body weight and blood sugar. Excessive activation of Agrp neurons is known to dampen melanocortin signaling. This effect has been linked to diabetes development in people and rodents. The researchers noted that prohibiting melancortin signaling after fibroblast growth factor 1 injection into the brain prevents sustained diabetes remission. Among other cell types that responded robustly to fibroblast growth factor 1 are tanycytes, elongated, nutrient-sensing glial cells found only in the hypothalamus. Their contributions to normalizing of glucose levels require additional study. The paper published in Nature Metabolism looked at structures that the scientists called “the previously unrecognized participants” in the mechanism behind fibroblast growth factor 1’s ability to induce diabetes remission. These are the perineuronal nets that enmesh blood sugar-regulating neurons in the hypothalamus, including Agrp neurons. The lead author of this paper is Kim Alonge, acting instructor in medicine at the UW School of Medicine. The senior author is Michael Schwartz. Perineuronal nets promote neurocircuit stability by enmeshing neurons and girding the connections between them. The researchers wanted to know if obesity-related diabetes is associated with structural changes in these perineuronal nets, and whether those could be treated. The research team noted that in the Zucker Diabetes Fatty rat model of type 2 diabetes, these nets are scarce in the hypothalamus compared to rats with normal blood sugar levels, Yet in other parts of the brain the nets are normal. This loss of perineuronal nets was rapidly reversed following a single injection of fibroblast growth factor 1 into the brain. The ability of fibroblast growth factor 1 to ameliorate diabetes was hampered by removing the nets through enzymatic digestion. In contrast, intact perineuronal nets are not required for fibroblast growth factor 1 to affect food intake. These finding identify perineuronal nets as key targets for sustained diabetes remission induced by the action of fibroblast growth factor 1. The researchers speculate that perhaps these nets help to constrain the activity of Agrp neurons and thereby pump up melanocortin signaling. The researchers plan to continue to try to bridge the gap between the cellular (and extracellular) responses to fibroblast growth factor 1 and the normalization of blood sugar levels. This, they hope, may ultimately uncover novel strategies for achieving sustained diabetes remission in patients.

    "title": "Who Should Get a Covid19 Vaccine First Experts Disagree ",
    "body": "2020/09/08 - The world is currently racing to develop a safe, effective, and accessible Covid19 vaccine. While these efforts tout new achievements every day and take us closer to a way out of this pandemic, medical experts and ethicists have also been trying to figure out one important, soon-to-be-pressing question: when we finally do get a Covid19 vaccine, its doses will be limited; so, who will get it first? People who are at high risk of contracting Covid19 and who are at risk for having severe symptoms should be prioritized, according to a proposal published last week by the U. S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. It drew its recommendations from past vaccination attempts during the H1N1 and Ebola outbreaks and outlined four criteria for determining who will get the Covid19 vaccine first — people who are at high risk of acquiring infection, who have a high morbidity and mortality risk, those on whom others depend on for essential work, and who are at most risk of transmitting Covid19 to others. Keeping these criteria in mind, the expert task force laid out four phases of vaccine distribution. The first phase would prioritize frontline workers (such as doctors and nurses) and older adults living together in institutions such as nursing homes, both to protect the group that is most vulnerable to Covid19, and the group that takes care of them. Phase 2 would bring in people who have underlying conditions that make them more susceptible to a severe Covid19 infection, and essential workers in society — food delivery workers, school teachers for example — on whom society depends on to normally function. Phase 3 would focus on young adults who are not severely affected by Covid19 but serve as asymptomatic vectors of transmission, and Phase 4 would bring in the rest of the population not covered by the other phases. This approach, however, was criticized by another group of experts that also released their own global vaccination distribution model last week, published in Science, offering up a ‘Fair Priority Model’ that instead centered social justice and equity, and denounced vaccine nationalism (countries hoarding more vaccine doses than they need for their own citizens). “It’s clear that health care workers aren’t equally high-risk, especially in developed countries, where proper PPE [personal protective equipment] has driven their risk down significantly,” Ezekiel J. Emanuel, one of the authors of the ‘Fair Priority Model’ and chair of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine, tells Scientific American. “The approach is biased toward rich, well-developed countries because those countries have more health care workers per capita and also have more elderly people. ” Related on The Swaddle: Waiting For a Vaccine Cannot be Our Pandemic Response Strategy Instead, the experts urged governments to focus on three main aspects of what equitable distribution could prioritize — “benefiting people and limiting harm, prioritizing the disadvantaged, and equal moral concern. ” This, they wrote, could happen in three phases — first would focus on reducing premature death, especially in poorer countries where it is more prevalent. Second would center the economic and social consequences of the Covid19 pandemic, such as the closure of schools and businesses that impact the livelihoods, and therefore, health, of populations around the world. And finally, the third phase would focus on reducing community transmission, targeted for countries with high transmission rates, geared toward restoring pre-pandemic freedoms and other economic and social activities. “From an ethical standpoint, there’s not a good reason for absolute partiality, where a country covers every one of its citizens before giving any vaccine internationally,” Emanuel says. But, “the problem is: there’s almost no definition of what ‘fair and equitable’ means, specifically in terms of distribution. ” In the interview, Emanuel also criticizes one of the World Health Organization’s proposed vaccine distribution models, which suggested giving the coronavirus vaccine to the top 3% of every country’s population, and then to 20% more, and so on. This, however, doesn’t take into account “that different areas of the world are suffering at different rates. Typically, when you’re giving international assistance, you give it to the people who are suffering most,” Emanuel says. The problem is that making sweeping statements about who is most at risk is a dangerous, and inconclusive practice — frontline workers are exposing themselves to Covid19 every day, but those who have proper PPE are at relatively low risk; older people with comorbidities are at risk, but medical research is unsure just how much a vaccine would help them in mounting a Covid19 immune response in the long run; people with underlying conditions are at risk, but in populations that have a high number of chronic illnesses, should the cancer patient get the vaccine over the person with an autoimmune disease? Experts around the world are currently struggling with these ideas, not just at the national, but also international level. Answering the question — who gets a Covid19 vaccine first? — is not easy, but asking it right now is imperative. "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - According to a report from the World Health Organization, cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, accounting for an estimated 9. 6 million deaths, or one in six deaths. However, the outbreak of Covid-19 has accelerated deaths due to cancer as hospitals are riveted by Covid-19 patients. The implications of the pandemic to the treatment of cancer were discussed in Episode-6 of HEAL-Thy Samvaad organised by the ‘Healthcare Advocacy Group’ — HEAL Foundation. The programme was conducted in association with The International Council for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD) last week. ALSO READ It’s ‘trading one health crisis for another’ Elaborating on the rising death rate of cancer, Harit Chaturvedi, Chairman, Max Institute of Cancer Care, said: “Of course, the obstructions created by Covid-19 for patients with cancer have increased the current death rate of cancer. However, there is no need to worry — but go for treatment positively. ” He added: “Cancer facilities are as safe as they were in pre-Covid times, so don’t delay treatment. ” Nutritional management On the prevention of cancer and the role of nutritional management in its care, Chaturvedi added: “Almost 50 per cent of cancer cases can be prevented if we take care of proper nutrition and a balanced diet. A healthy lifestyle, proper exercise, and intermittent fasting also help prevent cancer. “Addiction to tobacco and high-fat content intake in the diet and faulty lifestyle contributes to 35 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively in the incidence of cancer cases. Fruits, vegetables, yoga &amp; regular exercise help prevent cancer. The role of nutrition is pivotal in cancer prevention,” he added. Moderating the session, Manjari Chandra, Clinical Nutritional &amp; Founder, Manjari Wellness, said: “Research shows that certain plant foods contain powerful compounds — called phytochemicals — that can help fight cancer and reduce the risk of its development. ” She added that these specific foods may hold a key to prevent the growth of cancer cells in the body. During Covid times, the role of good nutrition has substantially increased as it helps boost immunity, which helps fight all types of diseases including cancer. This can also be corroborated by a research paper published in the Asia Pacific Journal of Cancer that stated the Covid-19 pandemic has taken a big toll on the clinical trials running for oncology, the study and treatment of tumours.

    "title": "AIIMS Researchers Sound Caution After Finding Zoonotic Malarial Parasite in Indian Patients",
    "body": "2020/09/08 - AIIMS researchers have sounded a note of caution after finding the presence of malarial parasite ‘Plasmodium knowlesi’ in the north Indian population, while doing a study on patients with Acute Febrile Illnesses (AFI) and pathogens causing them. The presence of the zoonotically transmitted malaria parasite was found during the study of Acute Febrile Iillnesses and causative pathogens in cerain patients admitted in AIIMS from July 2017 to September 2018. The All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) researchers from the Department of Biochemistry along with clinicians from the Department of Medicine were involved in the study on the pathogens causing severe fever. A zoonotic disease is a disease that can be spread/jump from animals to humans, and vice versa. It can be caused by viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi. It is necessary to understand how zoonotic diseases spread, and the way they infect humans, given the fact that the world is at present battling novel coronavirus that has emerged from bats. Plasmodium knowlesi is a malaria parasite found in nature in long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques. The team is led by Pragyan Acharya, Associate Professor, Department of Biochemistry, and comprises Manish Soneja from the Department of Medicine, along with Rajendra Mandage, Atreyi Pramanik, Parul Kodan, Vinod Sinha, Shivam Pandey and R. M. Pandey. “The major lesson from this study is that zoonotic parasites are all around us – therefore maintaining a clean environment and following specific guidelines for the prevention of these diseases are important,” Acharya told IANS. “A major reason for zoonotic pathogens’ effect on our lives is because we are encroaching the space of their animal hosts – massive decline in forest cover and consequent depleted habitats,” Acharya added. “However, this pathogen is not commonly tested during diagnosis, possibly due to its low prevalence and absence of rapid diagnostic methods. ” The researchers said that their study shows the presence of the zoonotic parasite in states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Delhi. An earlier study at AIIMS had shown its presence in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. According to the World Health Organisation, the parasite can give rise to daily fever spikes 9-12 days after the infection. Severe infection may lead to organ failure as well. Acharya and her team also found that simultaneous pathogenic infections in patients with fever can occur, influencing the severity of disease. The team found that malaria can exist with other co-infecting pathogens like dengue virus and bacterial species Leptospira and Orientia Tsutsugamushi. In tropical countries like India, acute febrile illnesses comprise a group of infections with similar clinical presentations such as fever, malaise, bodyache, chills, hepatic and renal dysfunction, and CNS effects. It is often difficult to distinguish between the causative agents of AFI, which can be bacterial, parasitic, or viral. Therefore, these pathogens may infect individuals at the same time and lead to modulation of immune responses, change treatment outcomes, and affect disease severity. The correct diagnosis of the infective agent causing fever is thus very important to ensure the right treatment. The study results ask us to be vigilant about the possibility of multiple pathogenic causes of fever, and to maintain the habitats and ecosystems of animals, the AIIMS researchers added. "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - Developer: What programming language would Julia users switch to? Watch Now Microsoft has decided to end Visual Studio Codespaces, the rebranded version of Visual Studio Online, and instead will merge it with GitHub’s take on the same product. Visual Studio Codespaces (formerly Visual Studio Online) is a cloud-based development environment aimed at making developers more more productive by creating a fully configured development environment in minutes. The announcement that Visual Studio Codespaces will be “consolidating” into GitHub Codespaces isn’t a surprise given the duplication between the two. SEE: Cheat sheet: Windows 10 PowerToys (free PDF) (TechRepublic) Microsoft announced the rebranded product in May at Build 2020 alongside the new GitHub Codespaces, which itself is a take on VS Codespaces. Both products are online companions to Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code (VS Code). According to Microsoft, the decision to move Visual Studio Codespaces to GitHub was to reduce confusion between the two near-identical products. “After the GitHub-native experience was released, we started hearing that the two distinct experiences were causing confusion amongst our users,” explains Allison Buchholtz-Au, a program manager for Visual Studio Online. “We believe that by consolidating the current Codespaces experiences into one, we can eliminate confusion, simplify the experience for everyone, and make more rapid progress to address customer feedback. ” The shift means Visual Studio Codespaces users will need to move to GitHub Codespaces by February 2021, when the Visual Studio Codespaces offering on Azure will end. What’s not clear yet is the pricing for GitHub Codespaces, which is currently in a private beta. In May, along with the rebrand from Visual Studio Online, Microsoft reduced the price of VS Codespaces in the Microsoft Azure cloud. Microsoft cut the prices of instances for Visual Studio Codespaces in Azure by more than half their previous prices. For example, the Basic tier with two cores and 4GB of RAM was reduced to to . 08 per hour, while the standard offer with four cores and 8GB of RAM on a Linux instance was reduced from about . 45 per hour to . 17 per hour. The premium tier with eight cores and 16GB of RAM was reduced from . 87 to . 34. Pricing for GitHub Codespaces hasn’t been finalized and there’s no mention of Azure on its website. Microsoft’s Buchholtz-Au notes that, from September 4, current Visual Studio Codespaces users can begin transitioning to the GutHub private beta. On November 20, Microsoft will prevent users from creating new plans and Visual Studio Codespaces, though existing ones will live on. At that point new users will only be able to sign up for Codespaces on GitHub. The final cut-off date comes on February 17, 2021, when Microsoft will shut the Visual Studio Codespaces portal and “all plans and codespaces remaining in the service will be deleted”. SEE: Seven Windows 10 annoyances (and how to fix them) As for pricing of GitHub Codespaces, Microsoft explains in an FAQ document that it will provide details later this year when GitHub Codespaces reaches general availability. “There is no charge for GitHub Codespaces while it is in limited public beta. Final pricing for GitHub Codespaces will be announced when Codespaces reaches general availability, which is expected later this year,” Microsoft states. “There is not a way to move Visual Studio Codespaces over to GitHub Codespaces. You will need to re-create your codespaces once you gain access to the GitHub Codespaces beta,” Microsoft notes. Hosting options are yet to be determined for developers who’ve used Visual Studio Codespaces with GitHub rivals like GitLab and BitBucket. “While GitHub Codespaces provides an optimized creation experience for GitHub repositories, we are currently iterating on the experience for repositories hosted elsewhere and will keep you updated as plans formalize,” Microsoft says.

    "body": "2020/09/08 - With such fierce competition on the GPU horizon thanks to Nvidia’s RTX 30 series, AMD is preparing to traverse the rocky roads ahead, cutting into its usual cycle of hardware releases to enter the bicycle market. You read that correctly. Not only can you brand yourself from head to toe in AMD gear, you can let everyone know you’re a part of the red team (or is it orange team, now?) with a new set of wheels. Available in the AMD fan shop to those in the US willing to pay a $50 shipping fee, there are two models to choose from: the AMD Custom Cruiser and the AMD Custom Mountain Bike. Both vehicles sport an 18. 5” frame and 26” aluminium wheels, but there are noticeable differences between them. Designed for the casual cyclist, AMD’s Cruiser is much simpler, forgoing gears and adding fenders to prevent dirt and muck from being thrown up. AMD’s Mountain Bike goes in the opposite direction, packing 21-gear Shimano index-shifting gears on a dual-suspension frame and linear brakes. And yet both cost the exact same amount at $299. Regardless of whether you choose a black frame with white wheels or a white frame with black wheels, you’ll be promoting AMD with a bold logo on the frame and Ryzen’s signature colour on the handlebars. If you truly want to show your dedication, though, you can always opt for the white frame with orange wheels, exclusive to the Mountain Bike. It’s not yet certain whether these bikes will see an international release, or just how serious AMD is about its travel products. Will we see AMD bunny hop from esports partnerships to extreme sports with its very own BMX? Only time will tell. "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - OnePlus 8T is tipped to launch later this year. (Representational photo) Every year OnePlus launches two new series and two smartphones under each. Similar was the case with the OnePlus 8 series and the same will happen with the OnePlus 8T series as well. Besides working on an affordable OnePlus phone dubbed Clover the company is also gearing up to bring OnePlus 8T. A report from Android Central reveals some details about the OnePlus 8T. The report reveals some of the key specifications of the upcoming OnePlus 8T and also when the phone will launch. Let’s take a look at everything that the report reveals about the upcoming OnePlus flagship smartphone. OnePlus 8T specifications (expected) According to the OnePlus 8T is codenamed Kebab. The report suggests that the OnePlus 8T will come with a 6. 55-inch AMOLED display similar to the OnePlus 8. The smartphone is tipped to come with a 120Hz screen refresh rate. The report suggests that the OnePlus 8T will feature two modes to choose from 60Hz and 120Hz. Sources close to the development revealed to the publication that the OnePlus 8T will pack four rear cameras at the back. The report suggests that the phone will include a 48MP primary image sensor, 16MP wide-angle module, 5MP macro, and 2MP portrait lens. This means that OnePlus will add an extra lens to the 8T when compared to the OnePlus 8. The OnePlus 8 features a triple rear camera setup including a 48MP primary sensor, secondary 16MP wide-angle, and third is a 2MP macro sensor. What is OnePlus Clover and everything we know so far The report further reveals that the OnePlus 8T will be powered by Qualcomm’s latest flagship processor Snapdragon 865+ processor paired with 8GB RAM with 128GB of internal storage. On the software front. the 8T is said to run OxygenOS 11 based on Android 11 out of the box. Earlier this week, alleged renders of the OnePlus 8T were revealed for the first time. The renders suggested that OnePlus will not bring a major change to the 8T when compared to the 7T launched last year. OnePlus 8T launch timeline According to the report, OnePlus 8T will launch by the end of September or the first week of October. At the same time, last year OnePlus announced the 7T. The smartphone manufacturer is yet to reveal details about the OnePlus 8T and also the official launch timeline. Meanwhile, the company is also working on an affordable smartphone dubbed OnePlus Clover. OnePlus recently launched the Nord, the first mid-range smartphone after the OnePlus One.

    "body": "2020/09/08 - Google Maps takes assistance from Deep Minds, a London-based AI lab owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet to get accurate results for users. Google, in a blog post, explains how the AI helps it collect data using neural networks to predict future traffic. This data includes live traffic information collected anonymously from Android devices, historical traffic data, information like speed limits and construction sites from local governments, and also factors like the quality, size, and direction of any given road, The Verge noted. “We then combine this database of historical traffic patterns with live traffic conditions, using machine learning to generate predictions based on both sets of data,” Johann Lau, product Manager Google Maps, wrote in the blog post. Other than the AI, Google relies on traffic data from authorities of local governments and real-time feedback from users. Google noted that its traffic predictions have been consistently accurate for over 97 per cent of trips. For the noted inaccuracy in Estimated Time Arrival (ETA), Google takes help of DeepMind using Graph Neural Networks that helps it in achieving accuracy. Google noted that it has seen improvements in Berlin, Jakarta, São Paulo, Sydney, Tokyo, and Washington DC. Through neural networks, Google Maps is able to better predict a journey well before it is even started. As per Google, the traffic patterns around the world have dramatically changed since the beginning of COVID 19 and so it will prioritise historical traffic patterns from the last two-to-four weeks, and deprioritise patterns from any time before that. In related news, Google Maps is testing a dark mode for the app. Until now, users were able to use the dark-mode in navigate option but as per a report by 9to5Google, Google may roll out an app-wide dark mode. However, it was just the APK versions that were uploaded by Google to the Play Store, meaning that they may or may not get materialised. The 10. 5. 0 version of Google Maps describes a new “Appearance” menu in Settings where users will have three options: Default to device theme, Dark theme, and Light theme. The report noted that creating a dark map is likely a big effort and not as simple as inverting colours. "

The company has been teasing key features about the smartphone over the past few days, so we have a good idea of what to expect. POCO looks keen to expand its product portfolio, which is why the company is not only launching the POCO M2 in India next week but also the POCO X3 globally. We’ll talk about the POCO X3 another time. For now, here’s a quick look at everything we know about the POCO M2, from its expected price in India to key specifications. Also read: POCO X3 leaked in hands-on video; specifications and price surface online POCO M2 price in India (expected) POCO M2 price in India is speculated to be under Rs 10,000 for the base variant. Like the company’s other models, there should be multiple RAM/storage options for users to choose from. POCO claims the POCO M2 is the most affordable 6GB RAM phone, which suggests the variant will be priced around Rs 10,000, while a possible 4GB RAM model will be under Rs 10,000. POCO M2 is already listed on Flipkart and will go on sale on the e-commerce platform following the launch. POCO M2 specifications POCO M2 is confirmed to come with a Full HD+ display with a waterdrop notch for the selfie camera. The phone is confirmed to come in a 6GB RAM option, but there could be a 4GB RAM variant as well. There is no word yet on the storage options for the POCO M2. The POCO M2 is likely to run Android 10-based MIUI 12 with the POCO launcher on top. Standard connectivity features could include 4G LTE, dual SIM support, and GPS. Moving to optics, not a lot is known but we can speculate it may have multiple camera lenses. The young brand is also teasing a big battery capacity, but this information is still under wraps. POCO M2 versus the competition The POCO M2, when launched, will look to take on the latest Redmi 9 Prime that comes with a Full HD+ display under Rs 10,000. Assuming the POCO phone is priced around Rs 10,000, other rivals may include the Realme C15 and Samsung Galaxy M01s. "

    "title": "Dell XPS 15 2020 review Window to ultimate luxury",
    "body": "2020/09/08 - Dell XPS 15 (2020) starts at Rs 1,90,495. 78. (Photo credit: Saurabh Singh/Financial Express) The XPS is widely regarded as Dell’s answer to the MacBook Pro. It is a line-up that Windows users look up to whenever they are looking to splurge on and expect the same level of finesse in craftsmanship and horsepower in performance. No other machine comes close. Though Dell keeps updating these machines with newer, faster processors and improved design from time to time, over the last few years, it has been criticised for not having updated the XPS 15 as much as the smaller – and relatively more mainstream — XPS 13. That changes with the XPS 15 in 2020. The XPS 15 in 2020 has a new design, new display, new hardware, and a new pricing and configuration strategy for India that reinstates the obvious – this is the window to the ultimate luxury. Design and build quality The XPS 15 is the best-looking laptop in the market today. Dell is using the same materials as last year; the only difference is that it is using them better. The lid and the bottom chassis are still made of high-quality metal. The keyboard deck is still made of aerospace-grade carbon fibre. But the edges now come with diamond cut finish and the hinge is so inconspicuous, the whole thing looks like it is one continuous slab of uninterrupted metal. The XPS 15 looks sharp and futuristic, the kind of laptop that will look good as much inside a boardroom, as it will outside on the coffee table. It is very well made – read, solid – too. The XPS 15 is the best-looking laptop in the market today. (Photo credit: Saurabh Singh/Financial Express) There is a catch though. At 2. 05kg, the XPS 15 is on the heavier side of things against a comparable 16-inch MacBook Pro, which makes its “edgy” design difficult to carry around, but that is a small price you pay for all that premium. For what it is worth, the XPS 15 is still one of the most compact 15. 6-inch laptops around. The XPS 15 looks sharp and futuristic. (Photo credit: Saurabh Singh/Financial Express) There are other big changes as well. For starters, the hallmark XPS edge-to-edge screen is truly edge-to-edge now. The chunky bottom bezel from last year is out of the window to entail an awe-inspiring 92. 9% screen-to-body ratio which is a 10% improvement from the previous model. Dell calls it a four-sided Infinity Edge display, and just maybe, this is one of those rare instances where a brand’s marketing mumbo jumbo means something. The display on the XPS 15 is one of its kind (more on that later). As is usually the case, Dell has both touchscreen and non-touchscreen options – the former also gets Corning Gorilla Glass 6 protection. Likewise, you can get the XPS 15 with FHD and UHD resolution. It is very well made – read, solid. (Photo credit: Saurabh Singh/Financial Express) The trackpad on the XPS 15 is 62% larger. The individual keys have been sized up too – these are now 9. 7% larger. The speaker grilles have been remapped and placed on either side of the keyboard à la the MacBook Pro. Lastly, this one also pulls the plug on legacy ports, instead giving you three USB Type-C ports. Interestingly, Dell has decided to retain a full-sized SD-card reader and audio jack, both of which are fast becoming a rarity in thin and light laptops. Display The display is the main reason why you would want to buy the XPS 15 and that is the main reason why you should buy it. No other laptop, including the MacBook Pro, offers as much per pixel quality as the XPS 15. Moreover, the size – which is 15. 6-inch – hits the sweet spot for most content creators. Dell also has a 17-inch model, that offers even more real estate just in case. The display is the main reason why you would want to buy the XPS 15. (Photo credit: Saurabh Singh/Financial Express) The XPS 15 is virtually all screen with up to 4K Ultra HD+ (this is what I have for review) resolution. The panel is LCD (and not OLED like last year) with 100% Adobe RGB, 94% DCIP 3 colour gamut, and Dolby Vision support. The aspect ratio also gets a refresh (speaking of which it is still a 60Hz panel) and it is 16:10 now which I personally think is better since it helps a great deal with productivity tasks and that is the kind of buyer the XPS 15 is intended for. The screen gets plenty bright, shows rich and vibrant colours, and viewing angles are great. Performance and battery life This is where things start to get interesting. In India, Dell is offering the XPS 15 in just two configurations. Both the configurations ship with a 10th Generation Intel Core i7-10750H (Comet Lake-H) processor. The i7-10750H is an 8 core, 16 thread processor built on a 14nm process node with a base clock speed of 2. 6GHz and boost speeds of up to 5GHz. The chip consumes 45W of TDP. Dell is offering the XPS 15 in just two configurations. (Photo credit: Saurabh Singh/Financial Express) Both the configurations also ship with the same Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 Ti which is a mid-range graphics card. This is paired with up to 32GB of DDR4-2933 RAM (dual channel), and 1TB PCIe NVMe M. 2 SSD. This is the top-of-the-line model and is priced in India at Rs 2,18,495. 78. The base configuration with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD, plus FHD non-touch screen display) comes in at Rs 1,90,495. 78. Single-core performance is good for a laptop of its class. Multithreaded performance is also mostly good which makes the XPS 15 an instant recommendation for content creators. Performance is at par – if not better – than an equivalently priced 16-inch MacBook Pro (that starts at Rs 1,99,900 for a model with 6-core Core i7. This is a laptop that you can also do some light gaming on, but it is not a gaming rig. There are dedicated machines for that (some of which are also cheaper). The XPS 15 tends to get hot at peak loads. (Photo credit: Saurabh Singh/Financial Express) While short-term performance has been good, I am more interested to see how this thing holds up in the long term though because there is (still) a big question mark on the thermals here. The XPS 15 tends to get hot at peak loads, which is during multi-tasking, and the dual fans get loud (and are distinctly audible which does not really bode well for such an expensive machine). The same question mark is carried forward to in battery life. Even though there is a sizeable 86Whr battery inside the XPS 15, the giant immersive screen and power-hungry processor mean, battery life leaves a lot to be desired. Depending on your mileage, you can get anywhere between 6-7 hours, which does not inspire a lot of confidence. The laptop supports fast charging through any of its three USB Type-C ports. A few quick pointers: The laptop supports fast charging through any of its three USB Type-C ports. (Photo credit: Saurabh Singh/Financial Express) The XPS 15 with its nice and tactile keys (1. 3mm of travel) and large trackpad (which is almost as big as the MacBook Pro’s) is an absolute joy to type on. The XPS 15 has a quad speaker setup consisting of two woofers on either side of the keyboard and two tweeters in the base. Together, the setup is capable of outputting 3D audio. They are quite good offering nice and full audio with minimal distortion at peak volume. Two of the three USB Type-C ports in the XPS 15 support Thunderbolt 3. The laptop also supports Killer Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5. 1. Dell bundles a USB-C to USB-A dongle in the box. The laptop has sensors in the lid to automatically detect and boot up the system when you open it. There is also a physical fingerprint reader. Should you buy the Dell XPS 15 (2020)? The XPS is widely regarded as Dell’s answer to the MacBook Pro. (Photo credit: Saurabh Singh/Financial Express) The XPS enjoys its own select clientele and then there are those who fancy it. For the former, I am happy to report that the XPS 15 is the most luxurious XPS that Dell has ever made. For the latter, I am afraid its high asking price and lack of lower configurations means, it is still hard to reach for many. But that is how the XPS has always been. You may not necessarily need it, but chances are you would still want it, because well, just look at it. Who would not want it? As for getting things done, I suggest you bump up your budget (if you can afford it) and try and go for the XPS 17 if you are serious about content creation. Even though the MacBook Pro offers more bang for your buck, the XPS 15 (or 17) is the only thing that comes close on the Windows side. It could have done with better thermals (and battery life) but there are also areas where it even trumps Apple’s latest and greatest. For a product like the XPS 15 that represents the bleeding edge of technology, it is alright that it is not perfect. Only then we can hope that the next iteration will be even better. Pros: Luxurious design Immersive display Excellent keyboard and trackpad Loud speakers Cons: Thermals need work Battery life could be better Pricey Also Read HP Pavilion Gaming 16 review: Challenging the status quo "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - The ban on PUBG in India has led to a rise in popularity of other gaming apps such as Garena Free Fire, Ludo King and Call of Duty, making them top gainers in terms of download after the government announced the ban on September 2. Data from Sensor Tower shows that Garena Free Fire, Ludo King and Call of Duty are the top three downloaded games across iOS and Android app stores between September 2 to September 5. While Garena recorded 2. 1 million downloads in the four-day period from India, homegrown gaming app Ludo King registered 1. 52 million downloads. Notably, Call of Duty received 1. 56 million downloads in the past 30 days of which 1. 15 million downloads came in just those four days. Data also showed that the three apps are leading the Google Play Store’s top chart for gaming categories in India since September 2. On Apple’s App Store, Call of Duty is at the top. Garena Free Fire was developed by Singapore-based Sea Ltd and Call of Duty by the American tech company Activision Blizzard. Tencent used to hold a 5% stake in Activision through its subsidiary TiMi Studios. However, Activision had recently parted ways with Tencent and TiMi. On September 2, the Indian government had banned 118 Chinese origin apps, including PUBG. The move has received a mixed response from the esports industry. Some companies said that the decision would impact organisers and broadcasters in India while a section of the industry favoured the move saying it would help the homegrown players. Soon after the ban, Indian gaming company nCore has announced a PUBG-like gaming app called FAU-G which is slated to launch in October. While the newly announced app has managed to make some buzz on social media, it would be interesting to watch how it lives up to expectations of gaming enthusiasts. "

    "title": "We asked you told us Samsung s new update policy would make you buy its phones",
    "body": "2020/09/08 - Samsung made waves roughly a month ago when it announced that it would offer three years of Android version updates to a variety of its devices. The Korean brand says it’ll offer three years of major version updates to the Galaxy S10 and up, the Galaxy Note 10 and higher, and several more devices. In fact, even the budget-focused Galaxy A series is getting in on the update action too, down to the mid-range Galaxy A51. So it got us wondering whether this pledge alone would be enough for customers to actually want to buy Samsung phones. Results The poll was published on August 22, drawing in 6,730 votes. And the results are overwhelmingly positive for the Korean brand. Almost 94% of readers said they’d buy a Samsung device due to this new approach to updates. Just over 6% of people voted in the negative, saying they don’t care about the new policy. We can’t say we’re surprised by this result at all, as a previous Android Authority poll found that roughly 96% of respondents wanted Android updates for three to five years. Furthermore, another Android Authority poll found that ~85% of readers wouldn’t consider a phone if it didn’t get a single major Android update. Related: Android 10 rollout — Which brand was fastest? It’s clear then that Android version updates are extremely important to our readers, as you’d expect. But will this update policy result in increased sales for Samsung? We’ll just have to wait and see. Your comments daftrok : It is a step in the right direction but to me security updates are more important than OS updates. 3 years OS and 4-5 years security would be ideal. Adrian Bönde: 3 years is not solving any issue. . it should be much longer. Apple has 5 years which should be the minimum for every smartphone! The hardware is capable of bringing more years of compatibility with the newest software releases and at these smartphone prices the companies should show responsibility by letting these phones live as long as possible! Jeshurun Kandy: I don’t really care about is updates from the manufacturer all that much as I’d much rather flash a custom ROM, with basically eternal updates especially for popular devices. – from my Galaxy Note 3 running Android 10 anonymous 42: This is great, i was already considering saving up and buying the Samsung A51 because it’s a great phone. And it’s good to know if i do get the phone, i would not only be getting a phone that’s have Android 10 and still getting Android updates but 3 of them. That’s mean i can get Android 13 when it’s comes, that’s more than even flagships. Another reason for me to try and save up for the A51. MM_Rafez : I would trade off 1 android version update with 2 years of additional security updates. D9: Good on Samsung. I can keep one of their phones for a couple of years and then pass it on to a relative or friend with some life left in it as far as software support goes.

A handful of other devices have followed suit, including the Galaxy Note 10 Lite which also received One UI 2. 5. As the rollout continues to expand, the company has now briefly turned its attention towards one of its older S Pen models, namely the Galaxy Note 8. The Galaxy Note 8 carrying model number SM-N950F is presently receiving the September 2020 security update in Nordic countries. As always, the update’s availability will expand to other regions in the coming days and weeks, so don’t feel left out if you have yet to received the update notification on your phone. The rollout process is gradual but it will eventually reach every one of the millions of Galaxy Note 8 units that have been sold by Samsung over the years. The latest update for the Galaxy Note 8 can be identified by firmware version N950FXXUDDTH1 and, as expected, it doesn’t seem to bring any new features to the aging S Pen device. In addition, Samsung has yet to detail the September 2020 security patch so it’s unclear what vulnerabilities it’s supposed to fix. Regardless, higher security is always welcomed and you should update your Galaxy Note 8 as soon as you have the opportunity to do so. If you reside in Nordic countries, you can try to trigger the update process by opening Settings on your phone, accessing Software update, and tapping Download and install. If you reside elsewhere, keep an eye out for new update notifications on your phone. Alternatively, you can refer to SamMobile’s firmware archives, download the latest Galaxy Note 8 firmware on your Windows PC and flash it to your phone manually. "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - It has long been rumored that Microsoft is working on two Xbox consoles for next-gen, aiming to claim both ends of the market. And now, we can confirm indeed that the pricing scheme should be very familiar, matching that of the Xbox One X and Xbox One S of yesteryear. We can confirm via our sources that the entry-level Xbox Series S will cost $299 at retail, with a $25 per month Xbox All Access financing option, which Microsoft is planning to push hard via various retailers and a large global rollout. The more powerful Xbox Series X will cost $499, with a $35 per month Xbox All Access financing option. Both consoles will launch on November 10, 2020. The Xbox Series S just leaked (via Brad Sams), giving us a glimpse at Microsoft’s entry-level next-gen SKU. The Xbox Series S is small enough to fit inside an Xbox Series X, and we expect it to be around 4TF RDNA2, making it roughly around as powerful as the Xbox One X, perhaps geared towards 1080p monitors with better frame rates. We don’t have further details on the console’s capabilities beyond that, but we expect NVME drives, and many of the newer “next-gen” features like fast resuming multiple games, and ray tracing. The Xbox Series X is a 12TF beast of a console that will boast 4K resolution and 60 FPS as standard, with some games, like Halo Infinite, going all the way up to 120 FPS in multiplayer. The prices Microsoft have put forward for the Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X put them firmly in-line with the Xbox One S and Xbox One X, and it will be interesting to see how Sony prices the competing PlayStation 5 in response. Microsoft will push Xbox All Access financing far more broadly than it did this gen, which was seen as a bit of a pilot program. We’re expecting Xbox All Access to roll out to far more markets than it did previously, and we also expect the Xbox Series consoles to gun for a global simultaneous launch in all existing Xbox markets, rather than the slow rollout we saw for the Xbox One in 2013.

This device has been leaking quite a lot recently, and today from Korea comes a new video, this time showing its swiveling display in motion, being rotated and whatnot. See for yourself: The T shape is definitely unconventional, as is this handset’s entire form factor. In a sea of similar looking glass slabs (and some foldable screen devices), this design is definitely fresh. What remains to be seen is how many people are going to be willing to pay around $1,000 for the Wing, especially considering it’s been rumored to forego a flagship chipset. The use cases this form factor enables are intriguing, but we’re left wondering how many third party apps are ever going to fully support the unique dual display solution at work here. On the plus side, the phone doesn’t look like it’s horribly thick in this video, so there’s that. Stay tuned for more leaks on the Wing as they appear, and hang around for the official announcement next Monday. Via "

This hints at the possibility of the G9 Plus launching at just under the Rs 20,000 price tag in India, when the company decides to bring the phone to our country. Once launched, the device will rival offerings from brands such as Realme, Samsung and Xiaomi, among others. "

Back when images of the Mate 30 series first started making their way online, it seemed like Huawei planned to release a Lite variant of the phone. Huawei never ended up announcing that device, but the company just revealed what is effectively a Mate 30 Lite by another name. The only problem is you’ll have trouble getting ahold of the Huawei Y9a if you live outside of the handful of markets where the company plans to sell the device. So far, we’ve only seen that it’s coming to Iraq where it will cost $239. Limited availability aside, the Y9a looks like it could be a decent mid-range option. The phone features a MediaTek Helio G80 processor and a 6. 63-inch LCD display with 2,400 x 1,080 resolution. The highlight of the Y9a is a 16MP pop-up selfie camera that helps give the phone a 92% screen-to-body ratio.

Rounding out the Y9a feature list is a side-mounted fingerprint sensor and a 3. 5mm headphone jack. At launch, Huawei plans to sell the phone in three colors: Space Silver, Sakura Pink, and Midnight Black. If Huawei decides to release the Y9a in more markets, we’ll let you know. "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - NASA has reached a milestone in the development of its newest telescope, Roman, set to launch in 2025, with the completion of its primary mirror. The Roman Space Telescope, named after the space pioneer and “mother of Hubble,” Nancy Grace Roman, will investigate distant facets of the universe including seeking to understand dark energy and searching for exoplanets. It will also look for wandering rogue planets, which could be far more abundant in our galaxy than previously thought. To look at into the depths of space, Roman needs a large primary mirror 2. 4 meters across which will allow it to capture a field of view 100 times that of Hubble. That primary mirror has now been completed and polished so finely that the average of the bumps on its surface is just 1. 2 nanometers tall. “Achieving this milestone is very exciting,” Scott Smith, Roman telescope manager at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, said in a statement. “Success relies on a team with each person doing their part, and it’s especially true in our current challenging environment. Everyone plays a role in collecting that first image and answering inspiring questions. ” The mirror is a key part of a telescope as it directs light to science instruments such as Roman’s Wide Field Instrument, essentially a giant camera, and the Coronagraph Instrument, which can spot distant planets by blocking out the glare from nearby stars. To make sure the data is as accurate as possible, the mirror needs to have a near-perfect finish. The mirror also needs to withstand the stresses of launch and the space environment, so it is made of special low-expansion glass which doesn’t expand and contract with temperature changes. By reducing the expansion and flex of the mirror, the telescope will be able to pick out more accurate details. The mirror has been extensively tested alone, and the next step is for the mirror to be tested while mounted in its support structure. “Roman’s primary mirror is complete, yet our work isn’t over,” said Smith. “We’re excited to see this mission through to launch and beyond, and eager to witness the wonders it will reveal. ” Editors’ Recommendations "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - A new research finding on radiation will support the UAE’s ambitious project to build the first human settlement on Mars by 2117, a scientist has revealed. “Radiation is one of the biggest roadblocks in planning long-term space missions, especially the project to establish a human presence on Mars [UAE’s Mars 2117 project],” said Dr Dimitra Atri, Research Scientist at Centre for Space Science in the New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD). In an interview with state news agency WAM, he said he has made important findings from his research on the impact of radiation on astronaut health in long-term space missions. His team has been able to calculate the amount of radiation dose deposited in different organs of the human body from astrophysical sources very precisely. “We found that radiation exposure to astronauts is comparable to the dose that cancer patients receive during radiation treatment,” he told WAM. “By comparing our calculations with radiation therapy data we have been able to estimate health risks to astronauts from background radiation in space,” Atri said. “Equipped with this knowledge, we will be in a better position to develop technologies to mitigate the impact of radiation and help with UAE’s efforts to establish a human base on Mars. We will be publishing our findings very shortly and share our results with the scientific community in the UAE and abroad,” he explained. The UAE’s Mars 2117 project includes putting in place a programme to prepare Emiratis for Mars and space exploration. The project aims to build the first city on Mars in 100 years. The project will be associated with research themes involved in the exploration of faster transportation systems to Mars, as well as building houses and producing energy and food. It will also try to find faster transportation methods for travelling to and from Mars. Previously, a senior scientist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), said that the UAE’s plan to build the first human settlement on Mars by 2117 would be possible. “I think we’ll get there,” said Dr Lori Glaze, planetary science division director at NASA, adding: “I would say that having multiple countries now [on Mars exploration] has increased our capability [globally] of going back and forth to Mars. ” Atri said that a planned space biology laboratory at the Centre for Space Science at NYUAD will support the UAE’s research aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The UAE has a prominent human spaceflight programme and its next step is to carry out scientific experiments on board the International Space Station, he added. The NYUAD Centre will also use data from Hope Probe, the UAE’s historic mission to Mars, he said. “We will combine data from Hope Probe with NASA’s Curiosity rover data, which is based at the Gale crater on Mars to understand how radiation propagates all the way down to the surface of the planet. This will help us better understand the radiation environment on the surface of Mars in case of extreme events which will be very useful in planning human missions on Mars,” Atri added. "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - Credit: CC0 Public Domain Herring gulls notice where approaching humans are looking, and flee sooner when they’re being watched, a new study shows. Researchers approached gulls while either looking at the ground or directly at the birds. Gulls were slower to move away when not being watched—allowing a human to get two metres closer on average. Newly fledged gulls were just as likely to react to human gaze direction as older birds, suggesting they are born with this tendency or quickly learn it. The study, by the University of Exeter, also confirms the widely held view that urban gulls are bolder than rural gulls—letting a person get on average 2. 5m closer before walking or flying away. “Herring gulls are increasingly breeding and foraging in urban areas, and therefore have regular interactions with humans,” said lead author Madeleine Goumas, of the Centre for Ecology and Conservation at Exeter’s Penryn Campus in Cornwall. “We know from previous research that gulls are less likely to peck a bag of chips if a human is watching—but in that experiment the researcher either looked at the gulls or turned their head away. “In our new study, the experimenter approached while facing the gull and only changed the direction of their eyes—either looking down or at the gull. “We were interested to find that gulls pay attention to human eye direction specifically, and that this is true for juveniles as well as adults—so their aversion to human gaze isn’t a result of months or years of negative interactions with people. ” The study was conducted in Cornwall, UK, targeting adult gulls (aged four years or older, evidenced by white and grey plumage) and juveniles (born in the year of the study, with completely brown plumage). A total of 155 gulls were included in the findings: 50 adults and 45 juveniles in urban settlements, and 34 adults and 26 juveniles in rural settlements. As well as being quicker to flee, rural gulls were also more than three times as likely to fly—rather than walk—away from an approaching human, suggesting they are less used to being approached. “The growing number of herring gulls in urban areas may make them appear more common than they really are,” Goumas said. “The species is actually in decline in the UK, and we hope our ongoing research into human-gull interactions will contribute to conservation efforts. ” The paper, published in the journal Animal Behaviour, is titled “Herring gull aversion to gaze in urban and rural human settlements. ” Explore further Staring at seagulls could save your chips More information: Madeleine Goumas et al.

Using various space observatories, astronomers have conducted multi-wavelength study of a high-magnetic-field pulsar known as PSR J1119−6127, which underwent an outburst in 2016. The results shed more light on the properties of this pulsar during the post-outburst period. The study is detailed in a paper published August 28 on arXiv. org. Pulsars are highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars emitting a beam of electromagnetic radiation. They are usually detected in the form of short bursts of radio emission, however, some of them are also observed using optical, X-ray and gamma-ray telescopes. PSR J1119−6127 was discovered in 2000 by the Parkes multibeam pulsar survey, likely associated with the supernova remnant G292. 2-0. 5 at a distance of about 27,400 light years. The pulsar has a spin period of 0. 407 seconds, a characteristic age of some 1,600 years and spin-down power of approximately 2. 3 undecillion erg/s. In late July 2016, NASA’s Fermi and Swift spacecraft detected magnetar-like X-ray outbursts of PSR J1119−6127 and also 13 short X-ray bursts. The total energy that was released during this event was estimated to be at a level of around 1. 0 tredecillion erg. To better understand the evolution of PSR J1119−6127 after the 2016 outburst, several teams of researchers started to monitor this pulsar. One such team, led by Huihui Wang of the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, carried out a multi-wavelength (from radio to gamma-ray band) study of PSR J1119−6127. For this purpose, they used data from Fermi, Swift, ESA’s X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission (XMM-Newton) and NASA’s Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). “In this study, we have performed a multi-wavelength study for PSR J1119−6127 after its 2016 magnetar-like outburst,” the astronomers wrote in the paper. Before the 2016 outburst, the X-ray pulse peak of PSR J1119−6127 was aligned with its radio pulse peak. The study found no substantial shift between these peaks after the outburst. It was noted that the observed X-ray spectra of both on-pulse and off-pulse phases are well described by two blackbody components plus a power-law model. In general, the radio and X-ray emission properties, as well as the spindown properties of PSR J1119−6127 after the 2016 outburst were found to be similar to those of the magnetar XTE J1810−197, which underwent an X-ray outburst in 2003. Wang’s study revealed that the evolution of the timing solution, radio emission and X-ray emission properties of PSR J1119−6127 after its latest outburst are very similar to those of XTE J1810−197. However, the recovery time scale and released total energy are one or two orders of magnitude smaller in PSR J1119−6127. When it comes to the GeV gamma-ray emission from PSR J1119−6127, the results indicate that it is slightly suppressed around the 2016 outburst. The GeV spectral characteristics after January 2017 (post-relaxation epoch) are consistent with that of the pre-outburst period. Moreover, the phase difference between the gamma-ray peak and radio peak in the post-relaxation stage is about 0. 4, which is consistent with the measurement before the 2016 X-ray outburst. Taking into account all the collected data, the astronomers concluded that the 2016 X-ray outburst probably caused a reconfiguration of the global magnetosphere of PSR J1119−6127and changed the structure of the open field line regions. They added that this reconfiguration continued for about a half-year after the outburst.

    "title": "Extreme precipitation events have always occurred but are they changing ",
    "body": "2020/09/08 - Credit: CC0 Public Domain Extreme weather and climate events causing extensive damage are a fact of the Canadian climate, and this year is no exception. On June 13, a mammoth hailstorm pounded Calgary with damage in excess of $1 billion dollars, the most expensive hailstorm in Canadian history. In early July, eastern Canada was subjected to both persistent extreme heat coupled with high humidity and major flooding. As we cope with these events, questions invariably arise about what role climate change may have played. Has a particular extreme been made worse because of our changing climate? How will these extremes change in the future? Water cycle accelerating Many of these questions are linked with the hydrologic cycle—the evaporation of water from the Earth’s surface and its vegetation, the transport of water vapor in the atmosphere from one place to another and the ultimate return of the water to the surface as precipitation. The water cycle speeds up when the climate warms. A warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor, creating the potential for more intense precipitation events. The evidence that human activity has warmed the global climate over the past century is incontrovertible. Satellite data available since 1988 indicate that the atmosphere has moistened, and that this is primarily due to the human-induced warming of the climate. Individual extreme events are, however, influenced by many other factors. A storm can leave behind moisture at the surface that can re-evaporate and strengthen subsequent events. The collision between a cold front and a lake breeze can lead to heavy precipitation. A delayed lake freeze-up during a warm winter can enhance lake-effect snowfall. Or a drought could limit local evapo-transpiration—evaporation from the land surface and transpiration from plants—eliminating the rainfall that comes from local moisture recycling and further intensifying hot, dry conditions. Heavy rainfall Many studies have examined precipitation-related change, usually focusing on average conditions rather than extremes. This is understandable because individual events, like a tornado or hail storm, are complex, and sparse ground observations and evolving techniques mean there aren’t yet long-term records that allow scientists to reliably estimate trends. In contrast, numerous rainfall records beginning in the 1950s or earlier exist across the globe. Statistical analyzes of data from these rain gages confirm that rainfall extremes have grown more intense at the global and continental levels, in agreement with climate models. There are broad indications that these changes in rainfall extremes are due to human influence on the climate at global and continental scales. Extreme one-day rainfall events that occurred about once every 20 years in the past are now occurring about once every 15 years. Even so, scientists still struggle to confidently say that a particular extreme rainfall event is the result of climate change. This is because there is naturally a large amount of variation in precipitation in one place, and the signal from climate change can get hidden within the natural noise. Future extremes Not all places have seen one-day rainfall extremes grow more intense over the past several decades, but that doesn’t mean it won’t happen in the future. The science indicates, with considerable confidence, that as the climate continues to warm, precipitation extremes will become substantially more intense in the mid-latitudes and northern land areas, including Canada. Although details are uncertain, heavy snowfall, freezing rain and hail will all change with continued warming. For example, a recent study suggests that large hail could become more likely in Alberta by mid-century, but less likely in some other parts of Canada. There is no doubt that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions have changed the climate. Nevertheless, the human imprint is often difficult to see in local meteorological observations. Despite that lack of direct “in your backyard” evidence, we should prepare for a future in which many precipitation-related extremes will become more intense.

    "title": "When antibodies mislead the quest for validation",
    "body": "2020/09/08 - Research antibodies are designed to recognize and bind to specific proteins according to their shape and chemical properties. Credit: Adapted from Molekuul/SPL Commercial antibodies are commonplace in biology laboratories. Researchers use these giant Y-shaped proteins to detect specific molecules in cells, tissues and test tubes. But sometimes the proteins detect other molecules, too — or even instead. When that happens, confusion can snowball. Consider the gene CR9ORF72. It’s often mutated in people with the neurodegenerative diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and familial frontotemporal dementia. But what it actually does has been hard to pin down, partly because the widely varying locations of the protein in the cell offer more confusion than clarity. Peter McPherson, a neuroscientist at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, suspects that the multiple locations arise from what is often seen as a trivial decision for detecting the protein: the choice of antibody. Antibodies work by binding to specific parts of a protein, according to the protein’s shape and chemical properties, but an antibody produced to bind to one protein can often bind to another, and sometimes with better affinity. That’s borne out in McPherson’s work. He and his team bought 16 antibodies marketed to detect CR9ORF72. Then they took a cell line that produces the protein at high levels and used the genome-editing tool CRISPR–Cas9 to make a line in which CR9ORF72 was knocked out, so the protein would not be present. They then assessed how the antibodies performed in the two lines in a series of common tests and found that the antibody that had been used in the most publications (and cited most often) found the protein even when it wasn’t there. Those that worked best for each assay had not appeared in the literature at all1. Others have reported comparable experiences. Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, tested 13 antibodies to try to untangle conflicting data about estrogen receptor β, a protein discovered in 1996 that is a potential anticancer target. Twelve of the antibodies, including the two most popular, gave either false positives or false negatives, or both, she and her team reported2. “Don’t take either the literature or the antibody for granted,” she warns. Antibody anarchy: a call to order Researchers often buy antibodies according to the number of times the product has been cited in the literature, but that strategy can overlook newer products that have been put through more rigorous tests. They also tend to assume that others who used the antibody before them checked that it worked as intended, and that it will therefore work in their own experiments, opening the door for self-perpetuating artefacts. “When I look at papers in general, I get depressed by the quality of the antibody characterization,” says Simon Goodman, a science consultant at the Antibody Society, a not-for-profit professional association. Goodman is based in Darmstadt, Germany, and has organized a series of educational webinars on appropriate techniques for the society3. “If you ask ‘how did you validate the antibody?’, researchers will say, ‘well we bought it and the producer says that it behaves like this. ’” Often, the data that companies provide to show an antibody works come from a cell line that has been engineered to express the protein at levels substantially higher than under physiological conditions. Researchers would do better to check that an antibody can detect the protein at physiological levels, in the technique and tissue type they plan to use and, ideally, that the signal fades or disappears when levels of the protein do. Validation drive There has been a steady drumbeat of efforts to make researchers more careful. In 2016, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) began requiring grant applicants to describe how they would authenticate antibodies and other key resources. Validation road maps have been printed, summits held and web portals established — Antibodypedia, Antibodies-online, Antibody Resource, Biocompare, CiteAb and Labome, to name a few. “The true game-changer has been CRISPR,” says Aled Edwards, who leads the Structural Genomics Consortium from Toronto, Canada, a public–private partnership devoted to doing basic science that can promote drug discovery. That’s because the technique makes it easy to perform useful control experiments, just as McPherson and his team did. Earlier this year, the antibody vendor Abcam in Cambridge, UK, introduced a suite of knockout cell lines and preparations that researchers can buy alongside its antibodies to test positive and negative cells under specific conditions in their own labs. The company now has more than 1,600 cell lines and 2,400 cell lysates available. An antibody signal in wild-type cells (top) should disappear in tissue in which the target protein has been knocked out (bottom). Credit: K. J. Rhodes and J. S. Trimmer/J. Neurosci. (2006, Society for Neuroscience) Edwards and McPherson helped to set up a Toronto-based charity called YCharOS (pronounced Ikaros), to put commercial antibodies to the test. They plan to use McPherson’s strategy to assess more antibodies against other targets, gauging performance across three common assays: immunoblot, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. They are also working with several antibody suppliers and pharmaceutical companies to develop standard operating protocols. As well as some in-kind corporate contributions, the NIH and the Parkinson’s disease charity the Michael J. Fox Foundation in New York City are providing initial funding of about US$300,000 to test a suite of antibodies used in neuroscience. Not every antibody can be tested using knockout controls, Edwards admits. About 10% of genes are essential to life, so a knockout cell line is not viable for them. Also, an antibody that performs well in one cell line could fall short in another. Still, these simple experiments can help to identify those antibodies that aren’t binding with their target protein. There are other methods researchers can try, too, such as coupling immunoprecipitation to mass spectrometry to see what proteins the antibody binds to4. Ultimately, says Edwards, “the onus is on the experimenter”. That said, it takes more than just the right antibody to yield informative experiments, says James Trimmer, who directs the NeuroMab lab at the University of California, Davis, an effort to produce high-quality antibodies for neuroscience. An antibody that works reliably when a protein is in its folded (‘native’) state inside a cell can perform differently when proteins are chemically altered in preserved tissue or unfolded in cell mixtures, and even small changes in sample preparation can have a large impact. Researchers need to know how their own methods compare with those used in validation experiments, and should avoid antibodies if the validation details are unavailable. “If you use them for the wrong purpose, they won’t be a good fit,” Trimmer says. Reproducibility crisis: Blame it on the antibodies It is not uncommon for labs to buy several antibodies and select the one that works best. But many developers license their antibodies to multiple distributors, who do not always disclose the antibodies’ origins. When setting out to test antibodies for C9ORF72, McPherson’s postdoc Carl Laflamme used CiteAb and the research literature to identify more than 100 antibody products. He then sent enquiries to vendors and scoured data sheets to rule out duplicates. Even so, the team realized later that 2 of the 16 antibodies they purchased from different companies were the same, so they had run a whole set of experiments unnecessarily. “We wasted our money and our time and effort,” McPherson says. Identity crisis Sometimes it’s not even clear which antibody researchers have used, especially in older studies. Only about 11% of the antibodies used in papers published in 1997 are identifiable, according to an analysis5 led by researchers at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), and the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in La Jolla, California; nowadays, that figure has risen to 43%. NatureTech hub Anita Bandrowski, head of SciCrunch and a bioinformatician at UCSD, is spearheading an effort to assign every antibody a unique identifier, called an RRID, and include it in publications. Researchers can find or request an RRID on the Antibody Registry’s website, and the identifiers would remain the same even if the vendor supplying an antibody changes its catalogue or goes out of business. Antibodies are much easier to find when journals mandate RRIDs, says Bandrowski. The journal Cell, for instance, asks authors for RRIDs, and 97% of its antibodies are findable5. Both Nature and Nature Research journals encourage the use of RRIDs to track key biological resources, including antibodies, cell lines, model organisms and tools. RRIDs can alleviate, but not solve, the problem of the same antibody being sold by many vendors: if the original source is clearly disclosed, all the antibodies can be assigned the same RRID. Bandrowski guesstimates that the 2. 5 million antibodies with RRIDs represent perhaps 700,000 unique molecules. But RRIDs do not distinguish between different batches of the same product, which can be particularly problematic for polyclonal antibodies, which are purified from the blood of immunized animals and are therefore more of a mixture than those made from cultured cells. The bottom line is: however an antibody-driven experiment comes out, researchers would be wise to be sceptical. When experiments fail, researchers often question their own technique, says Goodman. “Of course you blame yourself as a young scientist. ” But the scientific community should be equally sceptical of antibodies that seem to work, says Edwards, and demand evidence that they do before relying on them. “We buy antibodies, we don’t test them, and then we publish articles that send the field sideways. ” "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - Credit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain When historian Frederick Jackson Turner presented his famous thesis on the US frontier in 1893, he described the “coarseness and strength combined with acuteness and acquisitiveness” it had forged in the American character. Now, well into the 21st century, researchers led by the University of Cambridge have detected remnants of the pioneer personality in US populations of once inhospitable mountainous territory, particularly in the Midwest. A team of scientists algorithmically investigated how landscape shapes psychology. They analyzed links between the anonymised results of an online personality test completed by over 3. 3 million Americans, and the “topography” of 37,227 US postal—or ZIP—codes. The researchers found that living at both a higher altitude and an elevation relative to the surrounding region—indicating “hilliness”—is associated with a distinct blend of personality traits that fits with “frontier settlement theory”. “The harsh and remote environment of mountainous frontier regions historically attracted nonconformist settlers strongly motivated by a sense of freedom,” said researcher Friedrich Götz, from Cambridge’s Department of Psychology. “Such rugged terrain likely favored those who closely guarded their resources and distrusted strangers, as well as those who engaged in risky explorations to secure food and territory. ” “These traits may have distilled over time into an individualism characterized by toughness and self-reliance that lies at the heart of the American frontier ethos” said Götz, lead author of the study. “When we look at personality across the whole United States, we find that mountainous residents are more likely to have psychological characteristics indicative of this frontier mentality. ” Götz worked with colleagues from the Karl Landsteiner University of Health Sciences, Austria, the University of Texas, US, the University of Melbourne in Australia, and his Cambridge supervisor Dr. Jason Rentfrow. The findings are published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour. The research uses the “Big Five” personality model, standard in social psychology, with simple online tests providing high-to-low scores for five fundamental personality traits of millions of Americans. The mix of characteristics uncovered by study’s authors consists of low levels of “agreeableness”, suggesting mountainous residents are less trusting and forgiving—traits that benefit “territorial, self-focused survival strategies”. Low levels of “extraversion” reflect the introverted self-reliance required to thrive in secluded areas, and a low level of “conscientiousness” lends itself to rebelliousness and indifference to rules, say researchers. “Neuroticism” is also lower, suggesting an emotional stability and assertiveness suited to frontier living. However, “openness to experience” is much higher, and the most pronounced personality trait in mountain dwellers. “Openness is a strong predictor of residential mobility,” said Götz. “A willingness to move your life in pursuit of goals such as economic affluence and personal freedom drove many original North American frontier settlers. ” “Taken together, this psychological fingerprint for mountainous areas may be an echo of the personality types that sought new lives in unknown territories. ” The researchers wanted to distinguish between the direct effects of physical environment and the “sociocultural influence” of growing up where frontier values and identities still hold sway. To do this, they looked at whether mountainous personality patterns applied to people born and raised in these regions that had since moved away. The findings suggest some “initial enculturation” say researchers, as those who left their early mountain home are still consistently less agreeable, conscientious and extravert, although no such effects were observed for neuroticism and openness. The scientists also divided the country at the edge of St. Louis—”gateway to the West”—to see if there is a personality difference between those in mountains that made up the historic frontier, such as the Rockies, and eastern ranges e. g. the Appalachians. While mountains continue to be a “meaningful predictor” of personality type on both sides of this divide, key differences emerged. Those in the east are more agreeable and outgoing, while western ranges are a closer fit for frontier settlement theory. In fact, the mountainous effect on high levels of “openness to experience” is ten times as strong in residents of the old western frontier as in those of the eastern ranges. The findings suggest that, while ecological effects are important, it is the lingering sociocultural effects—the stories, attitudes and education—in the former “Wild West” that are most powerful in shaping mountainous personality, according to scientists. They describe the effect of mountain areas on personality as “small but robust”, but argue that complex psychological phenomena are influenced by many hundreds of factors, so small effects are to be expected. “Small effects can make a big difference at scale,” said Götz. “An increase of one standard deviation in mountainousness is associated with a change of around 1% in personality. ” “Over hundreds of thousands of people, such an increase would translate into highly consequential political, economic, social and health outcomes. ” "

    "title": "NASA Seeks BIG Ideas from Universities to Solve a Messy Moon Problem",
    "body": "2020/09/08 - NASA is reaching out to university students to help solve the problem of lunar dust as the agency plans for sustainable human exploration of the Moon under the Artemis program. Lunar dust is mostly made of small particles that stick to just about everything. It’s abrasive and can damage things, including spacesuits, equipment, spacecraft, and habitats. Dust can obscure camera lenses, reduce technology performance, distort instrument readings, alter thermal properties, and even cause equipment failures. Additionally, if dust gets into habitats, glass-like dust particles can lodge in astronauts’ lungs, creating health risks. Removing lunar dust from where it’s not supposed to be – or stopping it from getting there in the first place – is essential for future space exploration. Through its annual Breakthrough, Innovative and Game-changing (BIG) Idea Challenge, NASA is looking for a wide range of creative solutions from college and university students on the theme of lunar dust mitigation. Categories under the theme include dust prevention and mitigation during landings, spacesuit dust tolerance, exterior dust clean up, and controlling lunar dust within habitats. Competition judges will select between five and 10 teams to receive up to $180,000 each to build, test, and demonstrate robust lunar dust mitigation, or dust tolerant capabilities and technologies. “This competition gives students an unparalleled opportunity as members of the Artemis generation to help overcome the historically challenging technical obstacles of mitigating lunar dust,” said Niki Werkheiser, NASA’s Game Changing Development program executive within the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD). “Proving a readiness to provide meaningful technical solutions to support near-term lunar missions is key, because NASA may be interested in including all or part of viable concepts into a future space mission. ” The 2021 BIG Idea Challenge is open to teams of between five and 25 undergraduate and graduate students from accredited U. S. -based colleges and universities affiliated with their state’s Space Grant Consortium or partnered with an affiliated school, including Minority Serving Institutions. Teams are also encouraged to collaborate with industry partners. “We know our nation’s colleges and universities provide a reservoir of student talent and creativity that brings new perspectives and solutions to NASA,” said Mike Kincaid, associate administrator of NASA’s Office of STEM Engagement. “We hope to cultivate innovative ideas from diverse teams of students, and we are thrilled to continue fostering student contributions to NASA’s mission and work via Space Grant universities, especially as students across the country face many uncertainties. ” “We’ve designed this challenge so that teams have minimal constraints to create genuine out-of-the-box solutions,” said Drew Hope, Game Changing Development program manager at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. “Dealing with lunar dust will require incredibly creative and innovative approaches and collaborating with the Artemis generation through the BIG Idea Challenge is a strategic effort to fuel that type of innovation. ” Interested and eligible teams should submit their notice of intent by September 25, 2020. Proposal and video submissions are due by December 13, 2020. Finalist teams will be invited to present their solutions to a panel of subject matter experts from the agency and industry at the 2021 BIG Idea Forum, planned for November 2021. The 2021 BIG Idea Challenge is sponsored by NASA through a collaboration between STMD’s Game Changing Development program and the Office of STEM Engagement’s National Space Grant College and Fellowship Project (Space Grant). The challenge is managed by the National Institute of Aerospace.

    "title": "One Chart Shows The Best And Worst Face Mask Types Based on The Latest Research",
    "body": "2020/09/08 - A simple trick can reveal whether your face mask offers sufficient protection: Try blowing out a candle while wearing it. A good mask should prevent you from extinguishing the flame. The rule isn’t foolproof, but it should help weed out masks that aren’t very protective. Ever since the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began recommending cloth masks for the general public in April, researchers have been evaluating the best materials for filtering the coronavirus. An ideal mask blocks both large respiratory droplets from coughs or sneezes - the primary method by which people pass the virus to others - along with smaller airborne particles called aerosols, which are produced when people talk or exhale. It should be sealed around the nose and mouth, since any gaps, holes, or vents could allow droplets to leak out and potentially infect another person. Assuming masks are worn properly, certain materials consistently perform better than others in studies. Based on the latest research, here’s a ranking of the best and worst face coverings: (Yuqing Liu/Insider) ‘Hybrid’ masks are among the safest homemade options As a general rule, mask fabrics should be woven as tightly as possible. That’s why fabrics with higher thread counts are better at filtering particles. It’s also preferable to have more than one layer. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that fabric masks have three layers: an inner layer that absorbs, a middle layer that filters, and an outer layer made from a nonabsorbent material like polyester. N95 masks are the most protective because they seal tightly around the nose and mouth so that very few viral particles seep in or out. They also contain tangled fibres to filter airborne pathogens - the name refers to their minimum 95 percent efficiency at filtering aerosols. A recent Duke study showed that less than 0. 1 percent of droplets were transmitted through an N95 mask while the wearer was speaking. That’s why they’re generally reserved for healthcare workers. Disposable surgical masks are also made of non-woven fabric. A 2013 study found that surgical masks were about three times as effective at blocking influenza aerosols than homemade face masks (that was true, at least, when air flow was slower than a cough but faster than a human breathing during light work). Still, there are homemade options that come close to the level of protection of an N95 or surgical mask. An April study from the University of Chicago determined that “hybrid” masks - combining two layers of 600-thread-count cotton paired with another material like silk, chiffon, or flannel - filter at least 94 percent of small particles (less than 300 nanometres) and at least 96 percent of larger particles (bigger than 300 nanometres). Two layers of 600-thread-count cotton offer a similar level of protection against larger particles, but they weren’t as effective at filtering aerosols. That study, however, conducted measurements at low air-flow rates, so the masks might offer less protection against a cough or sneeze. Still, multiple layers of high-thread-count cotton are preferable to face coverings made from a dishcloth or cotton T-shirt. Fabrics like silk or cotton have more variable performances A June study published in the Journal of Hospital Infection found that masks made from vacuum-cleaner bags were among the most effective alternatives to surgical masks, followed by masks made from tea towels, pillowcases, silk, and 100 percent cotton T-shirts, respectively. Research from the University of Illinois, meanwhile, found that a brand-new dishcloth was slightly more effective than a used 100 percent cotton T-shirt at filtering droplets when a person coughs, sneezes, or talks. That study (which is still awaiting peer review) also found that a used shirt made of 100 percent silk was more effective at filtering high-momentum droplets, likely because silk has electrostatic properties that can help trap smaller viral particles. The University of Chicago study came to a different conclusion, however: Those researchers found that a single layer of natural silk filtered just 54 percent of small particles and 56 percent of larger particles. By contrast, four layers of natural silk filtered 86 percent of small particles and 88 percent of large particles at low air-flow rates. Bandanas and scarves don’t offer great protection Bandanas and scarves have performed poorly in multiple studies. The Journal of Hospital Infection study found that a scarf only reduced a person’s infection risk by 44 percent after they shared a room with an infected person for 30 seconds. After 20 minutes of exposure, the scarf only reduced infection risk by 24 percent. Similarly, the Duke researchers found that bandanas reduced the rate of droplet transmission by a factor of two, which makes them less protective than most other materials. For the most part, though, any mask is better than no mask, with one notable exception: The CDC cautions people not to wear masks with built-in valves or vents. Masks with one-way valves can expel infectious particles into the atmosphere, helping to fuel transmission. Mask studies should be taken with a grain of salt Although research is coalescing around the idea that a few types of masks offer the best protection, it’s not always easy to simulate how a mask will perform in real life. That’s because only some tests directly mimic the size of novel coronavirus particles, while others evaluate performance based on viruses like influenza. Researchers also still aren’t sure about the degree to which the virus gets transmitted via aerosols, since those tiny particles are extremely hard to trap and study without killing the virus. Some scientists even have different ideas of what constitutes an aerosol - the generally accepted cutoff is less than 5 microns (that’s roughly the size of a dust particle) - and many experts think the delineation is arbitrary altogether. Different studies also test masks under different circumstances: Some mimic the heavy air flow produced when a person coughs, while others mimic the air flow when a person is talking or breathing normally. And of course, masks perform differently depending on how they’re worn. That’s why it’s better to stick with more protection over less. This article was originally published by Business Insider.

    "body": "2020/09/08 - The primary mirror of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which will collect and focus light from the cosmic objects, has been completed. It has been developed in Maryland’s Goddard Space Flight Centre of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). With the help of this mirror, the telescope will capture space vistas, which will be better than Hubble space telescope, informed NASA. The field of view achieved with the help of this telescope will be 100 times more than Hubble images. Reacting to the progress made by his team, Scott Smith, manager of Roman telescope, said that it is very exciting for them to have achieved this milestone. He said, “Success relies on a team with each person doing their part, and it’s especially true in our current challenging environment. “ The scientists have used ultralow-expansion glass in the making of this primary mirror. This has been keeping in mind the fact that the mirror will experience a wide range of temperatures between earth and space. The primary mirror will send light to the Wide Field and Coronagraph instrument of the Roman telescope. The Wide Field instrument will help scientists to map the distribution and structure of invisible dark matter. It will also help in studying the planetary systems and evolution of the universe. The Coronagraph instrument will help in completely restricting the glare of the stars. This will enable astronomers to directly image planets. The vantage point of this telescope will be around 1. 5 million kilometers away from the Earth. The additional testing of the mirror will be conducted at L3Harris Technologies. Although the testing has happened at different temperatures, the new test will happen while it will be attached to its support structure. Smith believes that their work is not over even though they have made the primary mirror. He said, “We’re excited to see this mission through to launch and beyond, and eager to witness the wonders it will reveal. ” "

    "title": "Something Strange Happens on Mars During a Solar Eclipse",
    "body": "2020/09/08 - The moons of Mars are not quite like our Earth’s Moon. Phobos, the larger of the two, is much closer to its planet; compared to the Moon’s 27-day orbit, Phobos swings around Mars in line with the planet’s equator thrice every Martian day (sol). Solar eclipses, therefore, are much more frequent than those here on Earth. Phobos passes in front of - but never entirely covers - the Sun for an annular or partial eclipse somewhere on Mars most sols. Because Phobos is moving so fast, it never transits for more than 30 seconds. But, even during this brief time, the Mars InSight lander has recorded something peculiar happening. To the surprise of Mars scientists, during Phobos eclipses, the lander’s seismometer - the instrument that records ground motions to monitor possible quake activity - tilts, just an infinitesimal little bit, towards one side. Researchers at ETH Zurich’s Institute of Geophysics were actually studying data from Mars InSight to see if some of the effects of eclipses here on Earth also occur on Mars. Specifically: “When Earth experiences a solar eclipse, instruments can detect a decline in temperature and rapid gusts of wind, as the atmosphere cools in one particular place and air rushes away from that spot,” explained seismologist Simon Stähler of ETH Zurich. InSight is equipped with temperature and wind sensors - but these recorded no change in the atmosphere during Phobos transits. Atmospheric turbulence, atmospheric temperature, and barometric pressure remained pretty much consistent with a normal sol. The solar cells did, however, register the transits. Actually, it would be very curious if they didn’t, since Phobos can block as much as 40 percent of the Sun’s light - so it was reassuring that something went according to plan. “When Phobos is in front of the Sun, less sunlight reaches the solar cells, and these in turn produce less electricity,” Stähler said. “The decline in light exposure caused by Phobos’s shadow can be measured. ” But that was the extent of the “expected”. Because both the magnetometer and the seismometer chimed in with odd readings - the seismometer with its unexpected tilt. Actually, the oddity with the magnetometer - used to monitor the magnetic field on the Martian surface - was pretty easy to figure out. Two components showed a decrease very similar to the decrease in the current from the solar array. So the scientists deduced that the decreased current was likely the cause. “But we didn’t expect this seismometer reading; it’s an unusual signal,” Stähler said. “Imagine a 5-​franc coin; now, push two silver atoms under one edge. That’s the incline we’re talking about: 10^-8. ” It doesn’t seem to be a false positive; the signal is recorded for three transits, faint but real. The team expected that it might be a seismic response to the moon’s tidal - that is, gravitational - pull as it passed overhead. However, when they compared it to other readings of seismic activity from Mars, the signal bore no similarity to previous seismic activity. Another possibility is that the tether connecting the seismometer to the lander contracted. However, this would have produced a tilt in the opposite direction to what was observed. And a change in atmospheric temperature could have introduced a density change that nudged the seismometer, but, as we have already discussed, no such change was detected. But there was one more signal. An infrared radiometer recorded a slight drop in surface temperature during the longest transit, followed by a period of about a minute and a half while the ground warmed back up to its pre-transit temperature. This, the team believes, is the most likely cause of the strange reading. “During an eclipse, the ground cools,” said seismologist Martin van Driel of ETH Zurich. “It deforms unevenly, which tilts the instrument. ” A similar effect was observed in 1997, at the Black Forest Observatory in Germany. A technician forgot to turn off the light when leaving the seismometer vault, resulting in elevated noise in long-period data as the warmth from the bulb expanded the granite on which the seismometer rested. A series of experiments with artificial heat sources ensued, demonstrating that seismometers react almost instantaneously to heat changes in the seismic pillar. The team repeated their own version of this experiment, and found that they were able to obtain a signal consistent with the tilting of InSight’s seismometer. This information could be used to better understand Phobos and Mars, the researchers said. For one, InSight’s location is very accurately mapped. Knowing when a Phobos eclipse begins and ends at that location could help scientists more accurately constrain its orbit. And that, in turn, could help us understand what’s in store for Phobos’ future. The moon’s orbit is decaying at a rate of 1. 8 centimetres per year, slowing as it goes; eventually, scientists predict, it will grow so close to Mars that tidal forces will tear Phobos apart, turning it into a ring of debris circling Mars. If the slowdown can be characterised, that can tell us how elastic and warm the planet’s interior is - or how inelastic and cool. And that, in turn, can shed some light on Mars’ formation history. The research has been published in Geophysical Research Letters. "

    "title": "Meta DNA structures transform the DNA nanotechnology world",
    "body": "2020/09/08 - Meta-DNA structures transform the DNA nanotechnology world (Nanowerk News) A team of scientists from Arizona State University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) led by Hao Yan, ASU’s Milton Glick Professor in the School of Molecular Sciences, and director of the ASU Biodesign Institute’s Center for Molecular Design and Biomimetics, has just announced the creation of a new type of meta-DNA structures that will open up the fields of optoelectronics (including information storage and encryption) as well as synthetic biology. This research was published in Nature Chemistry (“Meta-DNA structures”) – indeed the meta-DNA self-assembly concept may totally transform the microscopic world of structural DNA nanotechnology. Models and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of various 3D polyhedra that were constructed by connecting the self-linked triangular M-DNA and rectangular M-DNA. From left to right: a tetrahedron, triangular bipyramid, octahedron, pentagonal bipyramid, triangular prism, rectangular prism, pentagonal and hexagonal prisms. (Image: Hao Yan) (click on image to enlarge) It is common knowledge that the predictable nature of Watson-Crick base-pairing and the structural features of DNA have allowed DNA to be used as a versatile building block to engineer sophisticated nanoscale structures and devices. “A milestone in DNA technology was certainly the invention of DNA origami, where a long single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is folded into designated shapes with the help of hundreds of short DNA staple strands,” explained Yan. “However it has been challenging to assemble larger (micron to millimeter) sized DNA architectures which up until recently has limited the use of DNA origami. ” The new micron sized structures are on the order of the width of a human hair which is 1000 times larger than the original DNA nanostructures. Ever since gracing the cover of Science Magazine in 2011 with their elegant DNA origami nanostructures, Yan and collaborators have been working tirelessly, capitalizing on inspiration from nature, seeking to solve complex human problems. “In this current research we developed a versatile “meta-DNA” (M-DNA) strategy that allowed various sub-micrometer to micrometer sized DNA structures to self-assemble in a manner similar to how simple short DNA strands self-assemble at the nanoscale level,” said Yan. The group demonstrated that a 6-helix bundle DNA origami nanostructure in the sub-micrometer scale (meta-DNA) could be used as a magnified analogue of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and that two meta-DNAs containing complementary “meta-base pairs” could form double helices with programmed handedness and helical pitches. Using meta-DNA building blocks they have constructed a series of sub-micrometer to micrometer scale DNA architectures, including meta-multi-arm junctions, 3D polyhedrons, and various 2D/3D lattices. They also demonstrated a hierarchical strand-displacement reaction on meta-DNA to transfer the dynamic features of DNA to the meta-DNA. With the help of assistant professor Petr Sulc (SMS) they used a coarse-grained computational model of the DNA to simulate the double-stranded M-DNA structure and to understand the different yields of left-handed and right-handed structures that were obtained. Further, by just changing the local flexibility of the individual M-DNA and their interactions, they were able to build a series of sub-micrometer or micron-scale DNA structures from 1D to 3D with a wide variety of geometric shapes, including meta-junctions, meta-double crossover tiles (M-DX), tetrahedrons, octahedrons, prisms, and six types of closely packed lattices. In the future, more complicated circuits, molecular motors, and nanodevices could be rationally designed using M-DNA and used in applications related to biosensing and molecular computation. This research will make the creation of dynamic micron-scale DNA structures, that are reconfigurable upon stimulation, significantly more feasible. The authors anticipate that the introduction of this M-DNA strategy will transform DNA nanotechnology from the nanometer to the microscopic scale. This will create a range of complex static and dynamic structures in the sub-micrometer and micron-scale that will enable many new applications. "

Using the MWA in the frequency range 98-128 MHz over a 17 hour period, a ∼400 deg2 field centred on the Vela Supernova Remnant was observed with a frequency resolution of 10 kHz. Within this field there are six known exoplanets. At the positions of these exoplanets, we searched for narrow band signals consistent with radio transmissions from intelligent civilizations. No unknown signals were found with a 5sigma detection threshold. In total, across this work plus our two previous surveys, we have now examined 75 known exoplanets at low frequencies. In addition to the known exoplanets, we have included in our analysis the calculation of the Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) upper limits toward over 10 million stellar sources in the Vela field with known distances from Gaia (assuming a 10 kHz transmission bandwidth).

    "body": "2020/09/08 - This August 2020 photo shows a normal mouse and a “twice-muscled” mouse developed at the The Jackson Laboratory of the University of Connecticut School of Medicine in Farmington. (Photo:AP) Bulked-up, mutant “mighty mice” held onto their muscle during a monthlong stay at the International Space Station, returning to Earth with ripped bodybuilder physiques, scientists reported on Monday. The findings hold promise for preventing muscle and bone loss in astronauts on prolonged space trips like Mars missions, as well as people on Earth who are confined to bed or need wheelchairs. A research team led by Dr Se-Jin Lee of the Jackson Laboratory in Connecticut sent 40 young female black mice to the space station in December, launching aboard a SpaceX rocket. In a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Lee said the 24 regular untreated mice lost considerable muscle and bone mass in weightlessness as expected — up to 18%. But the eight genetically engineered “mighty mice” launched with double the muscle maintained their bulk. Their muscles appeared to be comparable to similar “mighty mice” that stayed behind at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. In addition, eight normal mice that received “mighty mouse” treatment in space returned to Earth with dramatically bigger muscles. The treatment involves blocking a pair of proteins that typically limit muscle mass. A SpaceX capsule brought all 40 mice back in good condition, parachuting into the Pacific off the California coast in January. Some of the ordinary mice were injected with the “mighty mice” drug after returning and quickly built up more muscle than their untreated companions, Lee said. The scientists completed the experiment just as the coronavirus was hitting the US. “The only silver lining of COVID is that we had time to write it up very intensively” and submit the results for publication, said Dr Emily Germain-Lee of Connecticut Children’s Medical Centre, Lee’s wife who also took part in the study. Both are affiliated with the University of Connecticut. While encouraged by their findings, the couple said much more work needs to be done before testing the drug on people to build up muscle and bone, without serious side effects. “We’re years away. But that’s how everything is when you go from mouse to human studies,” Germain-Lee said. Lee said the experiment pointed out other molecules and signalling pathways worth investigating — “an embarrassment of riches…so many things we’d like to pursue. ” His next step: possibly sending more “mighty mice” to the space station for an even longer stay. Three NASA astronauts looked after the space mice, performing body scans and injections: Christina Koch and Jessica Meir, who performed the first all-female spacewalk last fall, and Andrew Morgan.

SpaceX released a video of the launch, short trip, and landing. The Starship’s test body looks vaguely like a massive flying water bottle — but in a weird way it makes the flight even more cool, like it’s defying the laws of physics. (A fully complete Starship would have a nose cone and landing legs. ) SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said earlier in the summer that the Starship was at the top of the company’s to-do list. He told employees speeding progress on the long-distance spacecraft – which will one day support crewed missions to other planets – “dramatically and immediately” should be their “top priority. ” The massive craft is, at least in theory, supposed to be able to carry 100 passengers to the moon, Mars, or anywhere else in space. Starship serves as a large, long-duration spacecraft capable of carrying passengers or cargo to Earth orbit, planetary destinations, and between destinations on Earth pic. twitter. com/NoNoOjBW50 — SpaceX (@SpaceX) September 29, 2019 SpaceX unveiled the re-usable Starship in 2019. Techcrunch called the successful hop tests a “very good sign for the spacecraft’s development program,” since other designs have never even reached this point. So it’s two short tests down, but still a long way to go until Mars. "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - It is no secret that the pollution in our environment is growing at an exponential rate, and the COVID-19 lockdown has done nothing to tame it. Most of the carbon dioxide is either absorbed by the air, in the atmosphere or absorbed by water bodies. Pixabay While researchers have been able to quantify emissions around the world. The bifurcation between how much is absorbed by the water versus how much is absorbed by the atmosphere is difficult to measure. And now, a recent study has revealed that the world’s oceans are soaking around 900 million metric tonnes of CO2. Just to put things into perspective, this is equal to ten percent of global fossil fuel emissions. This is according to researchers from the University of Exeter. They looked at total CO2 flux (flux meaning movement of greenhouse gases) from the year 1992 to 2018. They discovered that by accounting for the subsurface water, total carbon movement nearly doubled in some regions. Unsplash Professor Andrew Watson, of Exeter’s Global Systems Institute, explained, “Half of the carbon dioxide we emit doesn’t stay in the atmosphere but is taken up by the oceans and land vegetation ‘sinks’. Previous studies that have done this have, however, ignored small temperature differences between the surface of the ocean and the depth of a few metres where the measurements are made. Those differences are important because carbon dioxide solubility depends very strongly on temperature. ” He added, “We used satellite data to correct for these temperature differences, and when we do that it makes a big difference - we get a substantially larger flux going into the ocean. The difference in ocean uptake we calculate amounts to about 10 percent of global fossil fuel emissions. ” Why is more carbon emissions in oceans worrying? Even though CO2 in the air is mostly responsible for global warming and thus, less CO2 in the air equals that much better air quality, the damage it does to the oceans is considerable. Unsplash Researchers state that CO2 in a marine ecosystem turns water more acidic, which results in catastrophic damage to the already endangered coral reefs, resulting in coral bleaching. This causes creatures in that region to migrate while making them susceptible to danger. "

The sign of this finding is that even though the surface of the Moon is known to have iron-rich rocks, it is not known for the presence of water and oxygen, which are the two elements needed to interact with iron to create rust. ” Meanwhile, scientists from NASA have asserted that the earth’s oxygen very well had a role to play in the formation of this rust since hematite normally requires both oxygen and water.

    "body": "2020/09/08 - “Mars ain’t the kind of place to raise your kids,” Elton John helpfully informed us in “Rocket Man” nearly 50 years ago. And the emotions experienced by the song’s protagonist – a wistful astronaut having to leave his family behind for a journey to the Red Planet – lay at the heart of Netflix’s lavish new drama, “Away. ” It speaks volumes about the show’s lack of nuance that “Rocket Man” makes an appearance on the soundtrack early on, along with Debussy’s “Clair de Lune,” the Grateful Dead’s “Ship of Fools” and Van Morrison’s “Into the Mystic,” to hammer home its themes. But damned if it doesn’t all combine to create a celestial soap opera that’s as subtle as an asteroid but equally impactful. While most Earthlings are increasingly insistent that “There is no Planet B,” that message clearly hasn’t reached television executives – because by my count, “Away” is the fourth TV drama in the past five years to focus on a manned mission to Mars (not to mention Matt Damon and his “secret sauce” potatoes in Ridley Scott’s 2015 blockbuster “The Martian”). I’m guessing few people saw National Geographic’s “Mars,” about an attempt to colonize the planet in 2033, or the French drama “Missions,” a curio that unfolded over two seasons in 25-minute chunks, with the crew arriving on Mars at the end of the very first episode. The most high-profile show until now was Hulu’s “The First,”which remained frustratingly earthbound as it chronicled Sean Penn’s efforts to get a NASA mission to Mars off the ground after its predecessor experienced a catastrophic failure at takeoff. That 2018 show, which often seemed to exist as an excuse for Penn to show off his abs, suffered a similar fate, being canceled after only eight episodes. (The one thing it got right that “Away” ignores is the political question of why we should be spending billions on a space program while Earth goes to hell in a handbasket. “Away,” in comparison, is a glorified advert for NASA. ) So much baggage At the start of “Away,” the five-person crew on the three-year inaugural mission to Mars is already stationed on a lunar base and counting down the hours until blastoff. For viewers, the biggest question will be how their spaceship, Atlas I, could possibly take off given the amount of baggage each astronaut is carrying. As befits a streaming giant with a global reach rivaled only by the coronavirus, our five astronauts are drawn from four global superpowers, and Britain. The NASA Mars Joint Initiative is led – surprise! – by an American: commander Emma Green (Hilary Swank). Her second-in-command is Ram (Ray Panthaki), an Indian officer who’s loyal to his boss to a fault. Then there’s Russian engineer Misha (wonderfully portrayed by Israeli actor Mark Ivanir), who steals every scene as the experienced cosmonaut whose gruff exterior hides an even gruffer interior; Chinese chemist Wang Lu (Vivian Wu), the archetypally – nay stereotypically – dutiful professional who has left her family behind to become the first person to step foot on Mars; and British botanist Kwesi (Ato Essandoh), who has a crazy backstory we’ll get to later. Open gallery view Hilary Swank as Emma Green in Netflix’s “Away. ” Credit: /AP “The ‘right stuff’ isn’t about ego or swagger anymore. … It’s not about conquering space, it’s about enduring it,” Green says at one point – and boy does she have plenty to endure. Not content with experiencing a bad case of the working mom blues after “abandoning” her 15-year-old daughter Alexis (Talitha Eliana Bateman) for 36 months, there’s also the small matter of her partner, Matt (Josh Charles) – a NASA man himself – suffering a debilitating stroke while she’s on the lunar base and the mission nears its launch. The script’s most frequently repeated command is surely “Emma starts sobbing,” and Swank’s character may well prove too much for some. I can’t say the “Million Dollar Baby” star is my favorite actress, but there’s something about her performance here – in which she balances personal anguish with a desire to literally reach for the stars – that feels compellingly real, even allowing for the histrionics. Those scripts, mostly penned by Jessica Goldberg (“The Path”), generally manage to navigate between serving up plausible-ish, engaging characters and large-scale spectacle – such as a tense space walk set-piece early on, upon which the future of the mission depends. I did say it wasn’t subtle, right? This is a show that, ultimately, is not afraid to embrace its own cheesiness, offering us choice dialogue like “The further away I get, I’m actually just getting closer to getting back to you. ” In space, it turns out, no one can hear you scream – but they can hear you emoting, no matter what your nationality. Sitting alongside Emma’s parental guilt are her fellow travelers’ own problems: estranged offspring, secret loves, dead siblings and parents, health issues. Consequently, over the 10 episodes (the show has yet to be renewed for a second season), we’re put through the emotional wringer in a manner that’s actually more befitting of a medical drama than sci-fi show. For sure, no one watching “Away” is going to mistake it for Andrei Tarkovsy’s solemn sci-fi epic “Solaris. ” But with its flashbacks to pivotal events on Earth and dramatic incidents aboard the Atlas I, the show carries an undeniable charge. With the spaceship itself seemingly operating on autopilot for most of the eight-month journey to Mars, most of the buttons being pressed are seeking to secure an emotional response from the viewer. Deep space loneliness There are elements here of “Apollo 13” (the spaceship looks impressive, but it turns out to be a bit of a Friday vehicle), “Deep Impact” (a chaste love affair between two teens while potentially cataclysmic events take place in the heavens) and, yes, “Solaris,” with its depiction of deep space loneliness and memories of partners left behind on the Blue Planet. Open gallery view Ato Essandoh as Jewish botanist Kwesi as Misha (Israeli actor Mark Ivanir) looks on, in Netflix’s “Away. ” Credit: DIYAH PERA/NETFLIX “Away” also looks fantastic, its depictions of the crew experiencing zero-gravity conditions presented in such a matter-of-fact manner as to seem almost mundane. I particularly liked the scene in which the crew partake in some of Misha’s homemade vodka – alcoholic droplets floating playfully in the air as the astronauts squeeze them out of a syringe – and whenever they glide around the flight deck like modern-day Peter Pans. One of the show’s most interesting choices is to root some of the drama around religious beliefs, given the perpetual state of unhipness religion enjoys in most artistic circles. In this technological world where so much of the wonder is man-made, Kwesi is presented to us as a man of faith – and his journey from Ghanaian orphan to Torah-quoting Jewish botanist is definitely one of the most unusual backstories I’ve seen in quite some time, involving as it does his being adopted as a child by a super-rich Jewish woman and her Ghanaian partner. Then there’s Alexis’ new boyfriend, Isaac, whose idea of a hot date is to take “Lex” to Midnight Mass at Christmastime. I suspect this wholesome family drama may have the same effect on some viewers as NASA’s notorious “vomit comet” training aircraft had on wannabe astronauts back in the day. But there’s plenty to enjoy for those with sturdy stomachs and the inclination to check their cynicism at the door. “Away” is out now on Netflix "

(Reuters image) Asteroid 2020 news: Asteroids safely pass by Earth all the time, and there is no known asteroid impact threat for the next 100 years, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Asteroid Watch has said. NASA’s statement has debunked the common hearsay that most asteroids pose a threat to the Earth. Allaying the fear, NASA Asteroid Watch has indicated that civilisation-threatening risk from spatial objects is rarest of rare. “Regardless, stories sometimes surface with alarming headlines surrounding particular asteroids, so we like to reassure everyone when we see such conversations,” NASA Asteroid Watch said. The NASA Asteroid Watch has made the observation after an Asteroid named 465824 2010 FR — twice as big as the Pyramid of Giza— was expected to enter the Earth’s orbit on September 6. Now, descriptions such as “rocky horror” and “dangerous asteroid” emerged. “Our #PlanetaryDefense experts are not worried about asteroid 2010 FR and you shouldn’t be either because it has zero chance of hitting Earth.

Asteroids are described as rocky objects that orbit the Sun. However, these are much smaller than planets and also called minor planets. As many as 994,383 known asteroids are there as remnants from the formation of the solar system over 4. 6 billion years ago, as per NASA. There are three types of Asteroids. Firstly, there are Asteroids that are found in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Secondly, there are asteroids that share an orbit with a larger planet and these are known as trojans. The third type of Asteroids is Near-Earth Asteroids (NEA). These Asteroids generally pass close by the Earth. Among these, there are Earth-crossers which cross the Earth’s orbit. There are more than 10,000 such asteroids and out of which over 1,400 are classified as potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs). According to NASA’s Near-Earth Object Observations Programme, Asteroids with 140 metres or larger are of “the greatest concern”. However, NASA has been pointed out that no asteroid larger than 140 metres has a “significant” chance of hitting the Earth for the next 100 years, as per the Indian Express report. "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - Even though dark matter comprises 85 per cent of all matter in the universe, it does not interact with light and can only be seen through the gravitational influence it has on light and other matter. So what does dark matter look like? Recently, a team from Harvard &amp; Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics carried out a detailed simulation of the dark matter cosmos, resulting in some surprising observations. As per a statement released on Universe Today, the accuracy of any dark matter simulation depends on the assumptions one makes about it. In this case, the team assumed that dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) with a mass about 100 times that of a proton. According to study authors, WIMPs are one of the more popular theories of dark matter and similar computer simulations of WIMP dark matter have been done before. What set apart this simulation was that it was exceptionally high in resolution and featured on a scale ranging across thirty orders of magnitude. Researchers found that dark matter is formed in halos around galaxies. They also found that the haloes developed across all mass scales, ranging from small, planet mass haloes to galactic one and even massive haloes that form around clusters of galaxies. Scientists observed that all the haloes had a similar structure where they are dense towards the centre and start diffusing at the edges. The fact that this happened at all scales makes it an explicit feature of dark matter. The researchers revealed that while the small scale haloes are too small to be detected through gravitational influence on light, they could help answer how matter interacts with itself. According to them, one notion about dark matter is that when particles of a dark matter collide, they emit gamma radiations. Gamma ray observations have also been seen emitted from the centre of the Milky Way, which could be caused by dark matter. The simulation showed that most gamma radiation was produced by smaller haloes. Since the scale of a halo would affect the energy spectrum of the gamma rays, this model makes precise predictions about the gamma-ray surplus one should see both in the Milky Way and other galaxies.

Bengaluru based scientists have found that UV and blue light combination reversibly switches the system between 3D and 1D photonic structure — a novel interaction that can help make tunable and effective optical devices. In their quest to develop materials for tunable and effective optical devices, Scientists from the Centre for Nano and Soft Matter Sciences (CeNS), an autonomous institute of the Department of Science &amp; Technology, Govt. of India, have discovered that high levels of light in the blue wavelengths or actinic light lead to switching between two photo isomers — Chiral Nematic (Ch) and Twist Grain Boundary Smectic C* (TGBC*) which are liquid crystal phases possessing photonic structures in one and three dimensions, respectively. This work involving the research team of Rajalaxmi Sahoo, D. S. Shankar Rao, U. S. Hiremath, C. V. Yelamaggad, and S. Krishna Prasad from CeNS, has been published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry. The change occurs because of interactions between light and molecules leading to photoisomerization in which light of a specific wavelength (actinic light) can bend molecules with certain linking groups. A well-known example in this regard involves a change in the shape of a macromolecule of azobenzene derivatives from essentially linear to highly bent form when irradiated with Ultraviolet light (~ 365 nm). The phenomenon found by the CeNS involves reverse transformation on stimulation with blue light. This phenomenon is quite attractive to achieve photo-driven isothermal phase transitions in liquid crystal (LC) materials. Such photoresponsive LCs are attractive for applications, including flexible polarisers, patterned objects, logic devices, and energy harvesting materials. The present study also shows that photonic wavelength variations of over 100 nanometres can easily be achieved reversibly within a few tens of seconds, a feature that can find applications ranging from low reflection lenses and high reflection mirrors to colour changing paints and inks.

    "title": "Two Mammoth Impossible Black Holes Merge to Mark Most Massive Collision Ever Detected",
    "body": "2020/09/08 -  Artist’s impression of the binary black holes merger. (Mark Myers, ARC Centre of Excellence for Gravitational Wave Discovery (OzGrav)) At a Glance On May 21, 2019, astronomers detected four short wiggles of gravitational waves passing through the Earth. It was detected from a source which is five gigaparsecs away. The merger of the two black holes has led to the formation of new class known as intermediate-mass black holes (IMBH). A long time ago, seven billion years ago to be precise, two blackholes—deemed physically impossible to exist—collided to produce a cataclysmic explosion. On May 21, 2019, astronomers detected four short wiggles of gravitational waves passing through the Earth. The source of these signals has been traced back to this seven-billion-year-old collision, which happened more than ten billion light-years away. The discovery of this most massive source of gravitational waves to be detected so far were published in a peer-reviewed journal this week. The ripples coming from this insanely far away collision were picked by Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) based in the United States and its counterpart in Italy named Virgo. The discovery was published exactly five years after the first-ever gravitational wave was detected in September 2015. The gravitational waves are the disturbances or ripples in the space-time continuum caused by some of the most violent and energetic processes in the Universe. The existence of gravitational waves was first predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916 through his general theory of relativity and was empirically proved a century later. Most distant signal yet The short gravitational signal received by the LIGO in May 2019 was named GW190521 from a collision of two massive black holes. LIGO detected the ripples in the space-time continuum as four short wiggles, which lasted one-tenth of a second. It was detected from a source which is five gigaparsecs away, thus making it one of the most distant gravitational sources to be detected by LIGO. The signals were generated from two binary black hole mergers, both of whom lie in the ‘impossible’ range of black holes in terms of mass. The research paper explains that the two highly spinning black holes—about 66 and 85 times more than the mass of the Sun—collided and merged. The collision released an enormous amount of energy that spread across the universe in the form of gravitational waves. But this in itself has come as a surprise for the scientists. As per the statement from the Australian National University (ANU), whose scientists were involved in the discovery, the merger of the two black holes has led to the formation of a class black hole known as intermediate-mass black holes (IMBH) that has remained elusive for scientists so far. Mass of the black holes All the black holes detected till date largely fall into two categories: stellar-mass black holes (less than 100 solar masses) and a supermassive black hole (more than 1,000 solar masses). The black holes which have masses more than 100 to between 100,000 solar masses are IMBH. As per the research, these two black holes collided to form a black hole weighing 142 times the mass of the Sun. It is till date the biggest black hole detected through gravitational waves observation. This detection has offered scientists a rare glimpse at one of the classes of black holes never detected before. That’s’ why astronomers call it an ‘impossible’ black hole. “We are very excited to have achieved the first direct observation of an IMBH in this mass range. We also saw how it formed, confirming that IMBHs can be produced through the merger of two smaller black holes,” said Professor Susan Scott from the ANU Research School of Physics, a co-author on the publication. Supermassive black holes (SMBH) are those that are usually at the centre of the galaxies and were formed during the early years of the Universe. Stellar black holes, on the other hand, have a mass less than 100 times that of the Sun and are formed due to the collapse of stars. Merging black holes remain a mystery Another ‘impossible’ aspect of the current discovery is the nature of the merging black holes. Astronomers hypothesize that the stars between 65-130 times the mass of the Sun go through the process known as pair-instability, which results in the star to be blown apart completely and thus leaving nothing behind, definitely not a black hole. Now, the heavier (85) amongst the two merging black holes is said to be the first-ever detection which is within the pair of instability mass gap. So, the question bothering physicists is how does a black hole with a mass in right in-between this ‘instability’ range exist? One popular theory is that the black hole is not a product of a collapsing star, but was a result of a similar merger that might have happened before. But, we are yet to find any such evidence. “The fact that we’re seeing a black hole in this mass gap will make a lot of astrophysicists scratch their heads and try to figure out how these black holes were made,” says Nelson Christensen, member of Virgo. The study was published in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letter this week and can be accessed here . ** For weather, space science and COVID-19 updates on the go, download The Weather Channel App (on Android and iOS store).

The International space agency took to micro-blogging site Twitter and shared beautiful images of the cosmic world with the caption, “Observing our universe in different kinds of light Milky Way”. “Each of these images combines data from our @ChandraXray Observatory with data from other missions,” NASA wrote. The compilation gives examples of images from different missions and telescopes being combined to understand better the science of the universe. Each of these images contains data from NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory as well as other telescopes. Various types of objects are shown (galaxies, supernova remnants, stars, planetary nebulas), but together they demonstrate the possibilities when data from across the electromagnetic spectrum are assembled.

    "body": "2020/09/08 - Specialists have anticipated that by 2100, 558 mammal species may get extinct if preservation endeavors are not improved. ‘On the basis of the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature)-based scenario, we predict 558 mammal species’ extinctions globally by the year 2100,’ the study authors wrote. Further the authors said, ‘We are losing biodiversity every year, and with every extinct species and population, we lose unique evolutionary history. ’ Currently there are 5,700 surviving types of well evolved mammals. In the previous 126,000 years in any event 351 warm blooded animal species have become wiped out. Of those 80 are known from authentic reports since the year 1500, while all others are just known from fossil or zooarchaeological records. ‘Tobias Andermann from University of Gothenburg in Sweden and his partners applied numerical methodology that applies probabilities to measurable issues to the fossil records to gauge how mammalian annihilation rates have changed in the course of recent years, gathering explicit occasions of rate expands. The analysts anticipated a rate acceleration of ‘unprecedented magnitude’ for the not so distant future. As per the examination the eradications in the previous hundreds of years are just a ‘hint of something larger’ even with approaching terminations of the following decades. Nonetheless, the examination creators likewise note that notwithstanding the hazardous degree of current danger, there is as yet an opportunity, a little fateful opening to forestall annihilation of numerous species by improving conservation endeavors.

    "body": "2020/09/08 - FP Trending The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), on 30 July, launched its fifth Mars mission, the Perseverance Mars rover to bring the first Martian rock samples back to Earth to be analysed for evidence of ancient life. As NASA’s Mars rover Perseverance continues on its journey towards the Red Planet, the space administration conducted a driving test full-scale engineering version of the six-wheeler’s twin on Earth. Called Optimism, Perseverance’s twin’s test took place in a warehouse at Jet Propulsion Laboratory on 1 September. Engineers now expect to take it out to the Mars Yard — a field of red dirt studded with rocks and other obstacles that stimulate the Red Planet’s surface. According to Anais Zarifian, the mobility testbed engineer at JPL, Optimism is the test robot that comes closest to simulating the actual mission operations Perseverance will experience on Mars. Since Perseverance is not flying to Mars with a mechanic, the team needs to see how Earth-bound vehicle system testbed (VSTB) functions to figure out how hardware and software will perform before they transmit commands to the rover on Mars. Optimism is an acronym for Operational Perseverance Twin for Integration of Mechanisms and Instruments Sent to Mars. Optimism will share space in the Mars Yard with Maggie (Mars automated giant gizmo for integrated engineering), the engineering model that stands in for NASA’s Curiosity rover. NASA’s Matt Stumbo, the lead for the VSTB rover on the testbed team added, “The Curiosity mission has learned lessons from Maggie that were impossible to learn any other way. ” According to Stumbo, since now they have Optimism, it will be easier for them to know everything they need to succeed with the Perseverance mission on Mars. As per NASA, the Mars 2020 mission is part of a larger programme that includes missions to the Moon as a way of preparing human exploration of Mars. "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - July brought us the best close-up photos of the sun that the world has ever seen. Now, there are some new ones. In a new photo release from the Leibniz Institute for Solar Physics, we get up-close views of the sun’s surface, which looks like an elaborate network of fiery land masses that are in fact solar magnetic fields shown at a very high resolution. Image: KIS Another photo shows us what a sunspot, which appears as a darker speck on the surface of the sun, looks like up close. Mashable’s weekend team firmly noted that this image exudes major “butthole vibes. ” Apologies to the entire science community, but hey, it’s true. Image: kis The images come from Europe’s largest solar telescope, GREGOR. They’re some of the first to surface following a major upgrade project that the telescope went through. “This was a very exciting, but also extremely challenging project. In only one year we completely redesigned the optics, mechanics, and electronics to achieve the best possible image quality. ” project lead Dr. Lucia Kleint said in the press release. The team apparently saw a major breakthrough in March 2020 when the global pandemic left them “stranded” at the observatory. They used that time to “set up the optical laboratory from the ground up” but weren’t able to grab images of the sun due to winter snow storms. “When Spain reopened in July,” the release continued, “the team immediately flew back and obtained the highest resolution images of the Sun ever taken by a European telescope. ” The images released in July, meanwhile, came from the Solar Orbiter. That one, a joint project between NASA and the European Space Agency, launched the telescope-equipped satellite into space on Feb. 9. The photos we saw in July come from its first “close” pass by the sun, at roughly 77 million kilometers from the star. GREGOR’s images, meanwhile, were captured here on Earth by a very high-powered telescope. The level of detail evident in the images is incredibly impressive, but so too is the upgrading of the telescope itself. Especially in such a short period of time. “The project was rather risky because such telescope upgrades usually take years, but the great team work and meticulous planning have led to this success,” Dr. Svetlana Berdyugina, director of the Leibniz Institute for Solar Physics, said in a statement. “Now we have a powerful instrument to solve puzzles on the Sun. ” "

    "body": "2020/09/08 -  File photo: Chandrayaan 2 launch. (IANS/PIB) At a Glance Chandrayaan 3 will not carry an orbiter—but will include a lander and a rover to study the lunar surface. Despite the apparent hard landing of the lander, the Chandrayaan-2 mission is believed to be 95-98% successful. The Chandrayaan 1 mission had provided conclusive evidence for the presence of ice water on the poles. India’s Moon mission successor—Chandrayaan-3—may be launched somewhere in early 2021, as per the announcement from the Minister of State for the Department of Space, Jitendra Singh on Sunday. The third lunar mission was earlier scheduled for 2020, but the ongoing pandemic and the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of coronavirus has stalled many of Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) preparations for Chandrayaan 3. Earlier in June, the ISRO had pushed the uncrewed Gaganyaan mission also to a later date. In its second attempt, the Indian space agency is aiming to achieve a soft landing on the south pole of the lunar surface, which is least explored to date. Unlike its predecessor, Chandrayaan 3 will not carry an orbiter—but will include a lander and a rover to study the lunar surface. In one of the earlier announcements this year by ISRO, K Sivan had said, “The Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter will be used for communicating with the lander and rover of Chandrayaan-3 during their mission on the moon. ” Chandrayaan 2. (ISRO/IANS) Moreover, reports suggest ISRO scientists will also be considering incorporating improvements that experts have suggested after analysing what went wrong in the previous mission. One such priority could be ‘strengthening the legs of the lander’ so as to improve its chances of survival in the event of another crash. On September 7, 2019, the lander Vikram crashed on the surface while attempting a soft-land on the Earth’s only natural satellite Moon. As per ISRO, the lander’s trajectory began to deviate at about 2. 1 km above the lunar surface, and the mission control subsequently lost all communication with the lander. The agency failed to re-establish the contact despite persistent efforts for several weeks. Despite the apparent hard landing of the lander, the Chandrayaan-2 mission is believed to be 95-98% successful as all the instruments onboard the orbiter are functioning well and sending back data to ISRO. The mission has helped scientists to study the lunar atmosphere, topography, composition and other details. A decade ago, the Chandrayaan 1 mission had provided conclusive evidence for the presence of ice water on the poles, which is devoid of sunlight. Moreover, recently the data from the mission was also used to examine the presence of rust or hematite on the lunar surface. On the other hand, ISRO continues to rigorously work on one of its most anticipated missions, Gaganyaan—the first-ever human space mission. The training of astronauts has been going on in Russia and a couple of uncrewed precursor missions are likely to take off next year. ** For weather, space science and COVID-19 updates on the go, download The Weather Channel App (on Android and iOS store).

    "body": "2020/09/08 - Suzuki Motor Corp. has deferred its ambitious plan to sell at least 5 million cars a year in India by 2030 in a grim admission that the domestic automotive market will see more pain before a full recovery from the coronavirus-induced turmoil. Suzuki’s largest unit, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, has already trimmed capital expenditure plans for this fiscal, underscoring a squeeze on household incomes and job losses in an economy that contracted the most in four decades in the June quarter. “Earlier, it was established that the Indian market may grow to a scale of 10 million units by 2030. We believe these are achievable numbers. The only thing is that it may need a few more years. Compared to now, it is a huge increase,” said Toshihiro Suzuki, president and chief operating officer, Suzuki Motor Corp. , said at the 60th annual convention of the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (Acma) on Saturday. View Full Image Graphic: Sarvesh Kumar Sharma/Mint Enthused by the potential of the Indian market, Osamu Suzuki, chairman, Suzuki Motor, announced in 2018 that the company expects annual sales in India to grow to 10 million vehicles by 2030, with Suzuki controlling half of the market. This led the automaker to invest in a new plant in Gujarat with a capacity of 750,000 vehicles a year. A second plant with a similar capacity was also planned in Gujarat, to grow Maruti Suzuki’s total capacity in India to 5 million vehicles a year by the end of the decade. Mint reported in July that Maruti Suzuki has suspended building the second plant in Gujarat, which was earlier slated to open by 2021-22. The carmaker has also cut its capex plan for FY21 to ₹2,700 crore from ₹3,248 crore last year. Lower sales and profits at Maruti Suzuki are a cause for worry at its Japanese parent as it contributes more than half of Suzuki’s sales and profits. Analysts attributed Maruti Suzuki’s revision of sales targets to diminishing hopes of an immediate V-shaped recovery in automobile demand in India. “Regulatory environment became quite volatile in 2017, and the affordability of customers took a hit due to the new norms and economic slowdown. Going forward, the number of first-time customers will reduce since car prices have gone up while incomes have remained stagnant,” said Puneet Gupta, associate director, IHS Markit. The data and analytics firm has also lowered its annual sales projection for the Indian light vehicle market to 8 million by 2034, given the prevailing economic conditions. In 2018, the London-based firm predicted annual light-vehicle sales to reach around 9 million to 9. 5 million by 2030. To be sure, India’s automotive sector has been facing headwinds for several quarters, and covid has only worsened it. Vehicle manufacturers have been witnessing a double-digit decline in sales from the second half of FY19 due to economic slowdown, higher insurance costs and an increase in vehicle prices due to transition to new safety and emission norms. R. C. Bhargava, chairman, Maruti Suzuki, said the sales forecast of 10 million by 2030 was made when sales were growing by 8% each year, and Maruti was growing in double-digits. “In the last two fiscals, that has changed and demand for cars will depend on recovery in the economy,” he said, adding that “the decline in sales last year itself “put us in doubt about the 10 million figure”.

    "body": "2020/09/08 - Migrant labourers return to New Delhi from parts of Uttar Pradesh on August 8, 2020. (Express Photo: Praveen Khanna) Although most people expected India’s GDP to show substantial contraction when the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) released the data for the first quarter (April, May, June) of the current financial year on Monday, the broad consensus was that the decline would not exceed 20%. As it turns out, the GDP contracted by 24% per cent in Q1. In other words, the total value of goods and services produced in India in April, May and June this year is 24% less than the total value of goods and services produced in India in the same three months last year. Read in Tamil As Chart 2 bears out, almost all the major indicators of growth in the economy — be it production of cement or consumption of steel — show deep contraction. Even total telephone subscribers saw a contraction in this quarter. What is worse is that, because of the widespread lockdowns, the data quality is sub-optimal and most observers expect this number to worsen when it is revised in due course.

Source: McKinsey and Express Research GrOup. Chart 2: Percentage change in key indicators. Source: Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation Chart 2: Percentage change in key indicators. Source: Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation What is biggest implication? With GDP contracting by more than what most observers expected, it is now believed that the full-year GDP could also worsen. A fairly conservative estimate would be a contraction of 7% for the full financial year. Chart 1 puts this in perspective. Since economic liberalisation in the early 1990s, Indian economy has clocked an average of 7% GDP growth each year. This year, it is likely to turn turtle and contract by 7%.       Also read   Extent of damage clearer, stage set for second stimulus   In terms of the gross value added (a proxy for production and incomes) by different sectors of the economy, data show that barring agriculture, where GVA grew by 3. 4%, all other sectors of the economy saw their incomes fall. The worst affected were construction (–50%), trade, hotels and other services (–47%), manufacturing (–39%), and mining (–23%). It is important to note that these are the sectors that create the maximum new jobs in the country. In a scenario where each of these sectors is contracting so sharply — that is, their output and incomes are falling — it would lead to more and more people either losing jobs (decline in employment) or failing to get one (rise in unemployment). Chart 3; source: McKinsey Chart 3; source: McKinsey What causes GDP contraction? Why hasn’t the government been able to curb it? In any economy, the total demand for goods and services — that is the GDP — is generated from one of the four engines of growth. The biggest engine is consumption demand from private individuals like you. Let’s call it C, and in the Indian economy, this accounted for 56. 4% of all GDP before this quarter. The second biggest engine is the demand generated by private sector businesses. Let’s call it I, and this accounted for 32% of all GDP in India. The third engine is the demand for goods and services generated by the government. Let’s call it G, and it accounted for 11% of India’s GDP. The last engine is the net demand on GDP after we subtract imports from India’s exports. Let’s call it NX. In India’s case, it is the smallest engine and, since India typically imports more than it exports, its effect is negative on the GDP. So total GDP = C + I + G + NX Now look at Chart 4. It shows what has happened to each of the engines in Q1. Chart 4: Engines of growth falter. Source: MoSPI and Express Research GrOup Chart 4: Engines of growth falter. Source: MoSPI and Express Research GrOup Private consumption — the biggest engine driving the Indian economy — has fallen by 27%. In money terms, the fall is of Rs 5,31,803 crore over the same quarter last year. The second biggest engine — investments by businesses — has fallen even harder — it is half of what it was last year same quarter. In money terms, the contraction is Rs 5,33,003 crore. So the two biggest engines, which accounted for over 88% of Indian total GDP, Q1 saw a massive contraction.       Read   LAC chill, GDP fall, Covid surge: storm hits heated markets   The NX or the net export demand has turned positive in this Q1 because India’s imports have crashed more than its exports. While on paper, this provides a boost to overall GDP, it also points to an economy where economic activity has plummeted. That brings us to the last engine of growth — the government. As the data shows, government’s expenditure went up by 16% but this was nowhere near enough to compensate for the loss of demand (power) in other sectors (engines) of the economy. Looking at the absolute numbers gives a clearer picture. When the demand from C and I fell by Rs 10,64,803 crore, the government’s spending increased by just Rs 68,387 crore. In other words, government’s spending increased but it was so meagre that it could cover just 6% of the total fall in demand being experienced by people and businesses. The net result is that while, on paper, government expenditure’s share in the GDP has gone up from 11% to 18% yet the reality is that the overall GDP has declined by 24%. It is the lower level of absolute GDP that is making the government look like a bigger engine of growth than what it is. 📣 Express Explained is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@ieexplained) and stay updated with the latest What is the way out? When incomes fall sharply, private individuals cut back consumption. When private consumption falls sharply, businesses stop investing. Since both of these are voluntary decisions, there is no way to force people to spend more and/or coerce businesses to invest more in the current scenario. The same logic holds for exports and imports as well. Under the circumstances, there is only one engine that can boost GDP and that is the government (G). Only when government spend more — either by building roads and bridges and paying salaries or by directly handing out money — can the economy revive in the short to medium term. If the government does not spend adequately enough then the economy will take a long time to recover.       Read   Only farm sector output sees growth, outpaces overall GDP for 3rd straight quarter   What is holding back the government from spending more? Even before the Covid crisis, government finances were overextended. In other words, it was not only borrowing but borrowing more than what it should have. As a result, today it doesn’t have as much money. It will have to think of some innovative solutions to generate resources. Chart 4 by McKinsey Global Institute provides ways in which an additional 3. 5 per cent of the GDP can be raised by the government. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

    "body": "2020/09/08 - The Trump administration in the United States has started a US-China trade war and has been adding sanctions on Huawei. Now, as per the report, the United States is planning to ban China’s largest semiconductor manufacturer SMIC. SMIC relies on American chipmaking equipment. If the company gets added to the Entity List, that could make it more difficult to obtain the components needed to develop its capabilities and hurt the production of chipsets. The ban on SMIC could badly hurt Huawei given that the company is manufacturing budget HiSilicon Kirin chipsets. As of now, SMIC is the only option left for Huawei given that it has been banned from using chipsets or its related technology by any American company. The US Department of Defence is considering whether the chipmaker aids China’s military and defense apparatus. It alleges that SMIC worked with a large Chinese defense company and that university researchers linked to the military have tailored their work to fit SMIC’s technology. However, the company has denied those accusations. EDITOR’S PICK: Rollme Hero Pro Is World’s First Smartwatch to pack Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 4100+ chip Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), based in Shanghai, was founded in 20000. It recently raised around $7. 8 billion in a secondary listing on the Star Market in July, making it the biggest public offering in China in a decade. For this, the company withdrew its listing from the New York Stock Exchange. Although the company ranks among the top five semiconductor manufacturers in the world, it is far behind its competitors in terms of technology. While the likes of TSMC and Samsung have started manufacturing 5nm chipsets, SMIC is still using the 14nm process for manufacturing smartphone chips. ALWAYS BE THE FIRST TO KNOW - FOLLOW US! "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - The Kia Sonet will be launched in the Indian market on September 18, 2020, and is expected to be priced between Rs 6. 99 lakh and Rs 12. 99 lakh (ex-showroom) The sub-compact SUV range is one of the busiest spaces in the Indian market, with a total of five offerings currently plying in the segment, and many more to join soon. About a month ago, Kia Motors officially revealed its very own sub-4m SUV, the Sonet, which is all set to be launched on September 18, and will go on to become the third Kia car in the country. While we already know that the Kia Sonet will be sharing its platform, powertrains with the Venue, the former will come with a range of additional features over the latter. We have put together a list of the 7 such distinctive features that the upcoming Kia Sonet gets over its cousin and its biggest rival, the Hyundai Venue –  10. 25-inch Touchscreen Infotainment SystemThe Hyundai Venue comes packed with an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system that gets Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Hyundai Blue Link connectivity. On the other hand, Kia will be offering the Sonet with a biggest-in-class 10. 25-inch free-standing touchscreen infotainment system with smartphone connectivity and Kia UVO connected car-tech.  Multi-Drive Modes &amp; Traction ModesThe Sonet comes with three different drive modes, including Eco, Normal and Sport. Depending upon the mode chosen, the car alters its throttle response to deliver however you’d like it to. The Kia sub-4m SUV also gets three different traction modes over the Venue, namely Snow, Mud and Sand, which help you take on different types of terrains.  Fully-Digital Instrument ClusterKia has equipped the Sonet with a 4. 2-inch colour digital instrument cluster that surely goes well with the modern cabin design. The Hyundai Venue gets conventional analogue dials, along with a small multi-info display in the middle.  Ventilated Front SeatsWe’ve already seen ventilated front seats being offered with Hyundai cars like the Creta, Verna, Elantra, as well as both the Kia offerings that are currently on sale i. e. Seltos and Carnival. However, the Sonet will go on to become the first sub-compact SUV in the Indian market that will be offered with this feature, and considering the hot and humid weather of majority of the country, it is surely a welcoming feature at this price point.  Front Parking SensorsThe Mahindra XUV300 was the first car in the segment to be offered with front parking sensors, and the upcoming Kia Sonet will go on to become only the second car to get this safety feature. Front parking sensors are pretty useful when parking in or maneuvering through tight spaces.  Bose Music System with LED Sound Mood LightsWhile the Hyundai Venue does get four speakers and two front tweeters along with Arkamys audio, the Kia Sonet takes it a step ahead with its 7-speaker premium audio system from BOSE, which comes with LED Sound Mood Lights that changes in sync with the beat of the music playing through the car’s media system.  Diesel AutomaticThe Kia Sonet shares its platform as well as its powertrains with the Hyundai Venue. That being said, the Sonet gets the same 1. 2-litre four-cylinder NA petrol engine rated at 83 PS/115 Nm; the 1. 0-litre three-cylinder turbo petrol engine that makes 120 PS of maximum power and 172 Nm of peak torque; as well as the 1. 5-litre diesel motor that puts out 100 PS and 240 Nm. The transmission options include a 5-speed manual transmission for the 1. 2-litre petrol engine; a 6-speed iMT (Intelligent Manual Transmission) and a 7-speed DCT for the 1. 0-litre TGDi turbo petrol engine; and a 6-speed manual gearbox for the 1. 5-litre oil burner (100 PS/240 Nm), similar to the Venue. The Hyundai sub-4m SUV additionally offers an optional 6-speed MT wthe turbo-petrol powertrain. However, unlike the Venue, Kia is offering an optional 6-speed torque converter automatic gearbox for the 1. 5-litre CRDi diesel engine. What’s more is that Kia has decided to keep the power and torque output of the diesel-auto drivetrain the same as the car it is originally borrowed from – the Seltos. That being said, the 1. 5-litre diesel engine when had with the 6-speed auto on the Sonet, produces 115 PS of maximum power and 250 Nm of maximum torque – 15 PS and 10 Nm more than the diesel-manual.

    "body": "2020/09/08 - India-based Bharat Biotech has obtained regulatory approval to advance its Covid-19 vaccine candidate, Covaxin, into Phase II clinical trials from today. Developed in partnership with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) – National Institute of Virology (NIV), Covaxin is an inactivated vaccine designed to trigger antibodies against the virus. The Phase II trials will enrol 380 participants, said the Joint Drugs Controller of India Dr S Eswara Reddy in a letter sent to Bharat Biotech. According to the Joint Drugs Controller, the directorate had no objection to performing an adaptive, Phase I, followed by Phase II randomised, double-blind, multi-centre study. The study is intended to assess the safety, reactogenicity, tolerability and immunogenicity of the whole-virion inactivated Covid-19 vaccine in healthy participants. A statement from the Directorate General of Health Service read: “This is to inform you that the subject proposal was examined in consultation with SEC (Covid-19) experts held through virtual meeting on 3 September, wherein the committee recommended for the conduct of Phase II part of clinical trials with 380 participants subject to the condition that time for screening the participants should be revised in four days. ” In June this year, Bharat Biotech secured approval from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) to conduct clinical trials of Covaxin, marking the first regulatory nod for the country’s domestic vaccine to enter trials. Last month, the company reported that the vaccine candidate demonstrated an encouraging safety profile in a Phase I trial. The Phase I trial involved 375 volunteers at 12 sites across the country, including Post-Graduate Institute (PGI) of Medical Sciences and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi. Trial investigators collected blood samples from the participants to analyse the vaccine’s immunogenicity. "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - The State Bank of India (SBI) is planning a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) for which over 30,000 employees will be eligible. According to a report in news agency PTI, the state-lender is planning the VRS scheme to optimise its costs. Out of the 2. 49 lakh employees of the bank, at least 30,190 employees are eligible for the VRS scheme, which still awaits the board’s approval. The proposed scheme — ‘Second Innings Tap VRS-2020’ — is aimed at optimising human resources and costs of the bank. If 30 per cent of eligible employees opt for retirement under the scheme, the bank will save Rs 1,662. 86 crore, as per estimates based on July 2020 salary. The news agency PTI said that the draft VRS scheme will provide an option and a ‘respectable exit route’ to employees who have reached a ‘level of saturation in their career, may not be at the peak of their performance, have some personal issue or want to pursue their professional or personal life outside the bank’. SBI VRS Scheme 2020: Eligibility The scheme will be opened to all permanent officers and staff who have put in 25 years of service or completed 55 years of age on the cut-off date. The scheme will open on December 1 and will remain open till the end of February, it said, adding that applications for VRS will be accepted during this period only. As per the proposed eligibility criteria, a total of 11,565 officers and 18,625 staff members will be eligible for the scheme. SBI VRS Scheme 2020: Compensation “The staff member whose request for retirement under VRS is accepted will be paid an ex-gratia amounting 50 per cent of salary for the residual period of service (up to the date of superannuation), subject to a maximum of 18 months’ last drawn salary,” the PTI report quoting the VRS scheme said. Other benefits like gratuity, pension, provident and medical benefits will be given to employees seeking VRS. SBI VRS Scheme 2020: Cooling-off period A staff member retired under the scheme will be eligible for engagement or re-employment in the bank after a cooling-off period of two years from the date of retirement. Ahead of the amalgamation of SBI’s five associates with it in 2017, the merging subsidiaries had announced VRS for their employees. In 2001 also the bank had announced VRS with the objective to optimise human resources. However, the proposed VRS scheme is not finding favour with bank unions. Such a move at a time when the country is in the grip of COVID-19 pandemic reflects anti-worker attitude of management, National Organisation of Bank Workers Vice President Ashwani Rana said. "

    "title": "Airtel and Jio are renaming data caps and misleading consumers",
    "body": "2020/09/08 - When Jio announced “truly unlimited” wireline broadband, many naive people — myself among them — were quick to assume that words had meaning, that telecom operators respected the basic reality of language, and that this would be big for competition in the broadband industry. Then again, the devil is always in the fine print. Both Airtel and Jio, in their respective terms &amp; conditions, say that these “unlimited” high-speed plans actually have a data limit of 3. 3 terabytes. Gizbot was among the publications that first spotted this discrepancy. So essentially, both companies are misleading customers with their plans by inaccurately stating they are ‘unlimited’, and concealing deep in their company’s literature what they call a “commercial usage” limit. So it turns out that instead of challenging the competition, Jio was merely in lockstep with it; Airtel has had the 3. 3TB limit for a while, even as it put out a press release this weekend touting its “unlimited” plans. FUPs are disappearing into the fine print This isn’t new in the wireline broadband industry; Fair Usage Policies, or FUPs, have long been in place to slow down data speeds after customers use a certain amount of data. This age-old practice is essentially a data cap, but instead of ending internet access, ISPs slow it down after. What is new here is that Jio and Airtel, two of the largest telcos in the country, seem to have determined that communicating this limit is no longer necessary. Even in the US, whose fixed-line broadband industry is among the most non-competitive in the world, ISPs like Comcast have an entire page dedicated to telling consumers about a 1. 2 terabyte data cap they have in place in some places. Jio, by the way, does communicate this data cap — but only for “Titanium” users who pay extra for gigabit internet. Those users get 6,600 GB instead of 3,300 GB. Additionally, they get the basic courtesy of knowing what they are paying for. This has the somewhat amusing outcome of Jio’s “unlimited” plan costing less than half of its openly capped Titanium plan, with just a Rs 150 streaming subscription value difference: Jio also moved its clause on the 3. 3TB data limit from the top of its terms and conditions page for Jio Fiber to the bottom, where users are less likely to spot it. Our take: You might argue that 3. 3TB is enough for most people. Then again, that’s not really the point — “enough” does not mean “unlimited”. Vodafone-owned YOU Broadband has data caps that are around 4TB, but these are communicated clearly on its website, and the company doesn’t (for the moment) hide behind legal gray areas to make untrue marketing claims. Even if we do accept this argument of this much data being enough, consider that one hour of video on streaming services consumes a lot more data than it used to. In a family with multiple 1080p or 4k-enabled devices, services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video would suck hundreds of gigabytes from users’ data allowances over a month. Renaming and hiding data caps like this is a dangerous development, as other ISPs may follow suit to attract customers. In a billing cycle where a user has an unexpected hard drive backup restore thrown in, a few days of perfectly reasonable home data use morphs into “commercial usage” that slows down your connection. And a customer who paid for “unlimited” internet may be left scratching their head wondering what exactly that word was supposed to mean. We have reached out to Jio and Airtel for comment, and will update our post with their responses if we receive them. We have also reached out to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India for their thoughts on such marketing. "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - Representative photo: AFP BEIJING: Chinese firm Sinovac Biotech Ltd said on Monday its coronavirus vaccine candidate appeared to be safe for older people, according to preliminary results from an early to mid-stage trial, while the immune responses triggered by the vaccine were slightly weaker than younger adults Health officials have been concerned about whether experimental vaccines could safely protect the elderly, whose immune systems usually react less robustly to vaccines, against the virus that has led to nearly 890,000 deaths worldwide. Sinovac’s candidate CoronaVac did not cause severe side effects in a combined Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials launched in May involving 421 participants aged at least 60, Liu Peicheng, Sinovac’s media representative, told Reuters. The complete results have not been published and were not made available to Reuters. Four of the world’s eight vaccines that are in the third phase of trials are from China. For three groups of participants who respectively took two shots of low, medium and high-dose CoronaVac, over 90% of them experienced significant increase in antibody levels, while the levels were slightly lower than those seen in younger subjects but in line with expectation, Liu said in a statement. CoronaVac, being tested in Brazil and Indonesia in the final-stage human trials to evaluate whether it is effective and safe enough to obtain regulatory approvals for mass use, has already been given to tens of thousands of people, including about 90% of Sinovac employees and their families, as part of China’s emergency inoculation scheme to protect people facing high infection risk. The potential vaccine could remain stable for up to three years in storage, Liu said, which might offer Sinovac some advantage in vaccine distribution to regions where cold-chain storage is not an option. Such estimation is extrapolated from the fact that vaccines readings stayed within acceptable ranges for 42 days at 25 Celsius (77 Fahrenheit), 28 days at 37C (98. 6 F), and five months for 2-8C (35. 6-46. 4 F), Liu said, without disclosing complete data.

A top ED official told IANS, “Deepak Kochhar has been arrested under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act after daylong questioning. ” He was arrested by the Mumbai branch of the financial probe agency. The action comes almost a year after the ED filed a money laundering case last year on the basis of a complaint registered by the CBI against Videocon Director Venugopal Dhoot, his companies (Videocon International Electronics Ltd and Videocon Industries Ltd), as well as former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar and her husband Deepak. Earlier this year, the ED provisionally attached Rs 78. 15 crore worth movable and immovable assets in possession of ICICI Bank’s former Managing Director and CEO, her husband and the companies owned/controlled by him. During investigation it was revealed that loans were refinanced and new loans aggregating to Rs 1,730 crore sanctioned to Videocon Industries Ltd (VIL) and its group companies and these loans became non-performing assets (NPA) for ICICI Bank on June 30, 2017. Investigation further revealed that an amount of Rs 64 crore, out of the loan of Rs 300 crore sanctioned by a committee headed by Chanda Kochhar to Videocon International Electronics Ltd, was transferred to Nupower Renewables Pvt Ltd (NRPL, earlier known as NuPower Renewables Ltd, a company of Deepak Kochhar) by VIL on September 8, 2009, just one day after disbursement of loan by the ICICI Bank. Further, net revenue of Rs 10. 65 crore were generated by NRL from these tainted funds. Therefore, proceeds of crime amounting to Rs 74. 65 crore were transferred to/generated in NRPL. Investigation also revealed that Chanda Kochhar and her family acquired an apartment in Mumbai owned by one of the Videocon group companies, by way of acquiring that company through her family trust at a nominal price by creating book entries. Accordingly, assets amounting to Rs 74. 54 crore held in the name of Nupower Renewables Pvt Ltd, its subsidiaries, the flat located at Mumbai (book value of Rs 3. 5 crore), and amount of Rs 10. 5 lakh already seized by ED from company of Deepak Kochhar, totalling to Rs 78. 15 crore being proceeds of crime have been provisionally attached by ED under PMLA. — IANS "

As with the last post about the editor, you’ll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we’re using. Special formatting: As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:  strike through ==highlight== *escaped characters*Writing code blocks: There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks: . my-link {  text-decoration: underline;}If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.  Reference lists: The quick brown jumped over the lazy. Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference. Full HTML: Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits!

			<p>Developer: What programming language would Julia users switch to? Watch Now</p>

<p>Microsoft has decided to end Visual Studio Codespaces, the rebranded version of Visual Studio Online, and instead will merge it with GitHub’s take on the same product.</p>

<p>Visual Studio Codespaces (formerly Visual Studio Online) is a cloud-based development environment aimed at making developers more more productive by creating a fully configured development environment in minutes.</p>

<p>The announcement that Visual Studio Codespaces will be “consolidating” into GitHub Codespaces isn’t a surprise given the duplication between the two.</p>

<p>SEE: Cheat sheet: Windows 10 PowerToys (free PDF) (TechRepublic)</p>

<p>Microsoft announced the rebranded product in May at Build 2020 alongside the new GitHub Codespaces, which itself is a take on VS Codespaces. Both products are online companions to Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code (VS Code).</p>

<p>According to Microsoft, the decision to move Visual Studio Codespaces to GitHub was to reduce confusion between the two near-identical products.</p>

<p>“After the GitHub-native experience was released, we started hearing that the two distinct experiences were causing confusion amongst our users,” explains Allison Buchholtz-Au, a program manager for Visual Studio Online.</p>

<p>“We believe that by consolidating the current Codespaces experiences into one, we can eliminate confusion, simplify the experience for everyone, and make more rapid progress to address customer feedback.”</p>

<p>The shift means Visual Studio Codespaces users will need to move to GitHub Codespaces by February 2021, when the Visual Studio Codespaces offering on Azure will end.</p>

<p>What’s not clear yet is the pricing for GitHub Codespaces, which is currently in a private beta. In May, along with the rebrand from Visual Studio Online, Microsoft reduced the price of VS Codespaces in the Microsoft Azure cloud.</p>

<p>Microsoft cut the prices of instances for Visual Studio Codespaces in Azure by more than half their previous prices. For example, the Basic tier with two cores and 4GB of RAM was reduced to to .08 per hour, while the standard offer with four cores and 8GB of RAM on a Linux instance was reduced from about .45 per hour to .17 per hour. The premium tier with eight cores and 16GB of RAM was reduced from .87 to .34.</p>

<p>Pricing for GitHub Codespaces hasn’t been finalized and there’s no mention of Azure on its website.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s Buchholtz-Au notes that, from September 4, current Visual Studio Codespaces users can begin transitioning to the GutHub private beta. On November 20, Microsoft will prevent users from creating new plans and Visual Studio Codespaces, though existing ones will live on. At that point new users will only be able to sign up for Codespaces on GitHub.</p>

<p>The final cut-off date comes on February 17, 2021, when Microsoft will shut the Visual Studio Codespaces portal and “all plans and codespaces remaining in the service will be deleted”.</p>

<p>SEE: Seven Windows 10 annoyances (and how to fix them)</p>

<p>As for pricing of GitHub Codespaces, Microsoft explains in an FAQ document that it will provide details later this year when GitHub Codespaces reaches general availability.</p>

<p>“There is no charge for GitHub Codespaces while it is in limited public beta. Final pricing for GitHub Codespaces will be announced when Codespaces reaches general availability, which is expected later this year,” Microsoft states.</p>

<p>“There is not a way to move Visual Studio Codespaces over to GitHub Codespaces. You will need to re-create your codespaces once you gain access to the GitHub Codespaces beta,” Microsoft notes.</p>

<p>Hosting options are yet to be determined for developers who’ve used Visual Studio Codespaces with GitHub rivals like GitLab and BitBucket.</p>

<p>“While GitHub Codespaces provides an optimized creation experience for GitHub repositories, we are currently iterating on the experience for repositories hosted elsewhere and will keep you updated as plans formalize,” Microsoft says.</p>
